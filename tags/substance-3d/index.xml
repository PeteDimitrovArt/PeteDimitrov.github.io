&lt;p&gt;Quick update with some recoloring and some other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/orbital010.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Main camera angle. Compared to the previous post this time around the atmosphere and the color in the air are revamped. Most of the colors are in blue and teal, blue, green-ish ting. The only other color is of gold and yellow lights dotted around.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original concept had blue tint while my vision of it so far was mostly warm gray. (If you would like a reminder of how the original concept looks, you can find it in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;blog one of the series&lt;/a&gt;). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to follow the concept word for word, but I could not stop but feel I might be missing out by not trying the colors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such after some experimentation I landed on the colors you see above. I liked those quite a bit more than the original warm tomes I had going on. I then went into trying to clean up the portal / event horizon VFX even more. The previous one was too emissive and noisy for my liking and I though it was too busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another angle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00227.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Side angle showcasing the cylinder device in a spot where the right portal is on but the left one is malfunctioning and off. On the left one, that was in red lights last time, we now see a tint towards white and yellow lighting.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see I cut out the concept of the red, warning like colors. I still want to convey the idea of the gate being partially broken and malfunctioning, but maybe going for red and alarming colors was too obvious and easy. Sure it worked out but I think there are more creative ways to do it, I just have to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gamut-analysis&#34;&gt;Gamut Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/color-gamut-peter-dimitrov-cap073.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1524&#34;
	height=&#34;528&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two screenshots. Left is the old view of the scene, with red lights. The right side is the new view, with more yellow and blue lights. Next to each of those screenshot is a gamut look analysis, breaking down the colors and showing them onto a circular color selection with the colors used highlighted. When looking at the version with mostly yellow and blues, the color selection is clearly much more controlled and limited.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;288&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;692px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gamut is much more limited in colors now and I think the end result is quite more harmonic composition wise. You can see a reading of it in the picture above.
I added some cut and exposed wires but I have yet to try adding some sparks and other animated VFX. That might help sell the malfunctioning concept without the use of the red color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baking-normal-details&#34;&gt;Baking Normal Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I went into making some more pipes for the background. I also made a depth fade shader that gives a force field like effect where some of the pipes go through. Then I went into creating some hard surface stencils and baked details to use and stamp in Substance Painter. I modeled them in Maya and then baked normals of them in Substance Designer. I took those normals to use in Painter. I have just a few going on now but I&amp;rsquo;m going to make more in order to cover some of the otherwise empty areas on the panel surfaces of the portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 06 - Metals and Textures</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/orbital006.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 06 - Metals and Textures" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;texturing&#34;&gt;Texturing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Quick update with a latest preview of how the scene is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dived into UV mapping and some materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/orbital006.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main UE4 camera shot, showing the portal cylinder. Material and texture work can be seen, with the greebles now having metallic shine while cables appear rubber and blue and there are some golden trims scattered too.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the panels still don&amp;rsquo;t have textures. I went with silver/chromium look tied up with some gold and golden trims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;panels&#34;&gt;Panels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I managed to go through four of the panels and texture them. I laid them out on the same UV texture set so they share bitmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not completely happy with the detail, noises and colors on them, but I&amp;rsquo;m setting up everything with smart materials so I should be able to easily tweak all of them. I just need to UV map the rest tomorrow. Fun. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View of just the mapped panels plus the gate frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-cap073.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Substance Painter screenshot showing 4 panels and a cable asset bundle. View is Material to the left and AO to the right.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;153&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;368px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background I started with a trim sheet so I can easily introduce some patterns later on. Though arguably it will need some geometry there too as to not be too flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress&#34;&gt;Gif progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process gif:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-005.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;Timelapse process gif showing the build up from placeholder, plastic looking materials to ones that now have metal shine and detail.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll need to work more in order to balance the amount of detail on each panel through their textures. I want some panels to have golden elements too but I am going slow in order not to overwhelm it. Also I want to map and texture to the existing level the other 5-6 panels and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start trying the same changes uniformly on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to bake some normal stencils and decals that I will then stamp directly on some of the empty surfaces for some extra detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any comments are appreciated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember the scene from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, you would probably notice that it looks completely different. That is, looking at the atmosphere, at least. The layout is more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mist&#34;&gt;Mist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this idea, of having mist just above the surface, since the very start. I purposely postponed it until now, though, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get crazy with tweaking volumetric fog settings, alpha and fog cards and putting crazy amount of time in it, whilst not having the basic layout figured out or any of the props ready. But now, when nearly all of the props are ready, I had the time to sit down and work on vapor and smog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone wanting to recreate this, the ground mist is just a very large &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particle Emitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Its tied up to a &lt;em&gt;Clouds texture&lt;/em&gt;, pans a tiny bit, has a pretty short lifespan and is spawn cylindrical. After that its just a matter of tweaking your &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volumetric Fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; settings in your &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exponential Height Fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; volume. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure the guy in Epics &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd7-rTzfmCo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(14th minute mark)&lt;/em&gt; about Volumetric Fog in the Engine quickly recreates something very similar. The only part I added myself, is how I placed it in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s just below the surface of my Landscape. And that&amp;rsquo;s how I made it look like ground mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov15.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The cathedral seen from an angle closer to the ground. This makes the mist floating above ground more obvious.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stained-glass&#34;&gt;Stained Glass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, very important addition since last time, is the Stained Glass material that I created. It&amp;rsquo;s made from scratct in Substance Designer. What you see here is version 2.0, as the first one I created, I abandoned after a bit, as I though its shape was too simple. It had a diamond pattern going for it, and I wanted something more intricate looking than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov16.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Angled, closer shot of the cathedral. The tower and the right wing of it have a strong, mostly purple stained glass in intricate hues and patterns.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main approach to it was creating a base pattern and then picking up different areas of it and applying a few individual &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flood Fills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Each Flood Fill is turned to Color and then the hue, saturation and lightness of each shape that the Fill has picked up is randomised. The tricky part was giving it a shining look afterwards, in the Engine. If you look at just the material &amp;ldquo;ball&amp;rdquo; in Substance, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much on its own. To give it that emissive look, I masked just a small portion of the whole patter. I applied another Flood Fill (by now third) and gave it sharp, stained masked noise with a Slope Blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov17.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up shot of the stained glass. Circular motives that overlap into one another. Each different circle is colored in a different hue, raging from a lime, dark, cold green to an electric but warm red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m particularly happy with this approach, and it gave me one thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate and wasn&amp;rsquo;t aiming to achieve. If you look at the texture up close in Unreal (the screenshot above), the emission mask is distinct and clear (white magenta bits). As you start going further away from it, though, the Engine shrinks the texture quality a bit, which blurs the emissive pixels. Those pixels then, start to work together with the Bloom settings of the scene, and fill the whole glass surface with a dark, electric, blue color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/28_peter_dimitrov_neon_gravestones.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from Substance Designer showing node set up that creates the above described colored circles for the stained glass. The screenshot is focused on &amp;ldquo;Flood Fill&amp;rdquo; nodes.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;169&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;407px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As I described, you can feed an outline of your pattern towards a Flood Fill. You can then use a Flood Fill To Color to randomise the HSL of each generated shape. You can see all of that in the screenshot above.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are making a strained texture of your own, I would suggest experimenting with emissive mask, but also pay attention to your Bloom settings in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Processing Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A good combination of both, always makes for exciting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pattern of the texture, I was in parts inspired by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/blogs/steppenwolf/306A/substance-designer-random-things-3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matthias Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; techniques, which he shares over in his blog. Check that out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things are ready by now. I still have a few objects to put textures to. The boxes that you can still see are placeholder for hopefully some statues of something looking like a weeping angel. I want one or two of those, to contrast the very straight shapes of the rest of the headstones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also still working on the details of the main gate that you can see in the very first shot in this post. Facade details around the big window too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this project has been quite a fun journey. I think this will be my last post about it though. As long as it goes about approach explanation at least. My next one &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;hopefully&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; will be a gallery to showcase the final result. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on the video, to showcase the casket as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Casket as seen from a few posts ago, as I have a feeling some of you probably don&amp;rsquo;t even remember it. It&amp;rsquo;s still here! Going to animate it for a final video.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I started this project a few months ago, is my university. As such I&amp;rsquo;ll be submitting it as a thesis in about a week now. So that&amp;rsquo;s the deadline by which you will hopefully see the final result as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Some of you know I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of progress GIFs, so here is a very compressed final one.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
