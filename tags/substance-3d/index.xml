&lt;p&gt;At the end of the previous blog entry we looked in detail at the center platform and its sculpt. I showed how the mesh underwent a few changes, getting it from alien crop circles appearance to a more ordinary brick and pavement look. You could revisit those screenshots over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, slightly skip over looking at the lower walls of the environment and what I did with their sculpts. I also mentioned that we should look at the upper parts of the scene too, and briefly talk about the wall pieces, windows, and dome elements there.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Lower ground camera screenshot that is pointed towards the upwards parts of the scene. It reveals the orb floating in the middle of the scene, bathed in light (in the shape of alpha card God Rays). Above the orb one can see the circumference of the initial lower room shrink inwards. On the walls of that are windows cut in the form of circles. On the very top, the ceiling is dome shaped. It opens up like a flower flooding further with daylight the otherwise dark interior. Unreal Engine 5 screenshot.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roof-blockout&#34;&gt;Roof Blockout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, in this screenshot seen below we can see my initial blockout of the ceiling. My approach to putting the place together was as follows: I blocked out the lower levels walls. I put in the middle platform so the orb is centered, floating on it. I added little bridges and a bunch of pillars. I then added one upper level of walls - the ones where the circumference of the room shrinks once for the first time. It creates a dome like appearance where the pillars are. The walls above get to host some circle cut windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had all of this blocked out, I set on to sculpt further all of the above described assets. After sculpting them I did an initial texturing pass. Even then, when I still had no roof, I knew I want to create a dome appearance on the upper ceilings. I knew I want to open up a tall space around there and not end up the celling ending close to the orb, thus making a claustrophobic space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew and was planning all of that I had still not made most of the blockout upper assets and ceiling pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead once I had done the first sculpting and texturing pass of the lower levels, and once I had seen it work well and I liked it, I set off to continue the missing ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos026.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Image crop looking at the upper parts of the scene. Shows the dome ceiling building up few levels of shapes and silhouettes. The top one is the most intricate one, with flower and fractal elements. All of the upper parts have placeholder, gray, materials while the lower parts are textured. UE5 image.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;116&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;279px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is how the upper levels looked - in mid-blockout - when I was testing out the shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were I testing out the visual and silhouette of the shapes themselves but I also was engaged fully into looking at something else too: their use with light. I wanted to create interesting patterns at the very top that then would flood the lower parts of the environment in light that leaves spellbinding, exciting shadow silhouettes. Here light itself was my main attention and my main &amp;ldquo;asset&amp;rdquo;. It dictated what was going to happen with the sculpture pieces. Light inspired me in the making of the flower-like opening on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;564px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having figured what pieces work and what pieces I like from the initial Blender blockouts, I set off to take some of them inside Zbrush. The modular building pieces that I liked I retopologized in Zbrush using Dynamesh. I then further sculpted and polished details on top. Some I duplicated multiple times and shattered in different ways, deriving me extra dressings and details.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;347px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final step inside Zbrush I used Decimation Master in order to lower the polycount of each sculpt. I had most pieces sitting at 2-3 million tris. Nanite could handle that but it would result with each mesh being around 200-300 MBs, maybe even more. I found that would be needless given that this high density of poly was not exactly looking more detailed than a well decimated version that would be 100-200k tris (instead of 2-3m). The file sizes of those would be much more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember that we need to UV map these too. UV Mapping a 3m triangles sculpt would be much more taxing on Blender (and on us) than a 300k tris one, which would be a trivial task to uv map if one has a polished, good geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;door-asset&#34;&gt;Door Asset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above described process I used for the creation of the front door as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos029.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;85&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;206px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a quick shape exploration in Blender before moving anything into Zbrush. I played with an array modifier with rotations in order to try and get some interesting shape. Here I once again thought at light as my main asset, as such I wanted to create some silhouette that once lit would aggressively cast some interesting shadows in the middle of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos030.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another Blender screenshot. Looks at the door pieces bit further away from. The wall plate and circle cut are now more defined. The shape in the middle is more of a spiral instead of the previous inverted Zerg shape.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;91&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;220px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls to the left and the right were shapes just for placeholder as I knew I would use the existing modular walls in the project instead of making brand new ones unique to the corridor of this door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos031.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;367px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was slight difference in the process of making this door, when compared to the walls we looked at before. In here, I UV mapped my initial pieces and then in Zbrush used non-destructive approach both to the sculpting and the decimation of the topology by the end. That way I preserved my UV maps and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to re-map once the sculpts were ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same approach I used for the circular platform in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos032.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Zbrush screenshot showing the door. The sculpt here is now rich in detail and relief carvings on the surface. Image to the left shows the door at a slight angle, while the image on the right shows it from the very front, in orthographic view.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;361px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a detailed look at my sculpt pass on the door. I&amp;rsquo;ve not included the spiral shape as I thought its not necessary to run a sculpting pass on it - instead it could be ordinary Nanite mesh with just a tiling material on top.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;165&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;396px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the sculpt was done I decimated the asset while preserving UVs. I went into Substance Painter where I baked my maps and set off to texture. In the image above the UVs differ slightly compared to the Blender shots before. That&amp;rsquo;s mainly because I did some extra polish before taking it outside of Blender and into Zbrush. With that I utilized my UV space better to not have the empty space seen in the first Blender UV screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;god-rays-alpha-cards&#34;&gt;God Rays Alpha Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ceiling and the dome appearance was created I put in some god rays and atmospheric 2D alpha cards. Those face the camera at most of the times and if you wanted similar ones you could dig out materials and blueprints set ups from Epic over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/blueprints&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Blueprints - Legacy UE4 Sample Project&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is UE4 and its marked as Legacy in some spots, but the Blueprint set up (and materials) found in there for &amp;ldquo;God Rays&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Fog Cards&amp;rdquo; are set up incredibly well. Their design and function stands perfect even when migrated in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos035.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Unreal Marketplace screenshot. Shows the &amp;ldquo;Blueprints&amp;rdquo; sample project. The screenshot from the project seen above has a butterfly in the middle. If inspected closely, one can notice a long, bright god ray alpha card behind it. That is the ones we are after.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;220&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;529px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roots&#34;&gt;Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the alpha card rays implemented and my attention came back entirely on the lower parts of the scene. Where all of the &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; would take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at it and could see that it was sitting predominantly empty. No detail props or set dressings. Even the walls met the floors at a perfect 90 degrees angle which took away from the natural look of the space and made for an artificial CG look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to remedy that. As such I looked into making bundles of props I could scatter around and about. Pottery, ground dirt pile, smashed pieces of pots. Stone tablets with inscriptions or symbols on them. Fallen parts of the upper ceiling pillars, now sitting on the dusty floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet my walls remained empty. Overly simple. The upper parts of the environment had cracks and tons of damages on the walls, spilling in even further light and using that as a detailing asset. But the lower ones? They were mostly intact. Empty. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to dig out any holes there because the camera would be seeing straight out of them. That would break immersion, because, as you could guess, the exterior scene is completely empty. As such that idea was a no go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is when I started thinking about roots. What if oversized, magical, incredibly wide roots were spiraling around like snakes? They could populate the walls better and reach towards the middle of the room, towards the floating orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pitched that idea out loud to my friend Sophie Deschamps. She loved the idea so much, and being the cool artist she is, without me even asking, took the screenshot I had just sent her and painted over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got me this artwork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos036.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The environment captured from one of the usual camera angles seen before. On top is a concept paint over by hand. It consists of immense, magnificent roots crawling out of the window gaps and reaching towards the orb in the middle. Once a root reaches the middle, its width becomes smaller and it changes color into bright greens and blues. In the middle part the roots start to wiggle upwards, as if trying to reach and touch the orb in the middle of the scene. The orb is colored in an overpowering blue aura.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;173&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;417px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this concept paint over, I knew immediately. I knew that indeed this is the next move and as such I set of to making some roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not describe how helpful and inspiring this paint over was, as such, thank you, Sophie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blueprints-for-the-roots&#34;&gt;Blueprints for the Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My process behind making the roots was at first in big chunk in UE5 itself. The space is already blocked out and I wanted to have a direct and immediate way to &amp;ldquo;crawl&amp;rdquo; around different roots and see their influence and shape on the environment. As such I used a spline system Blueprint directly in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have opened Blender and positioned my floor and walls in the configuration I have in the scene. That would be a trivial and not very time consuming task as I already have all of my measurements set. Its just a matter of moving them from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I dislike jumping in and out of Unreal. I like doing as much as I could in the engine itself as that then keeps my art process with less friction. Frictionless means more creativity and energy spend towards whatever I am creating and not the dialogue that I have between the different software packages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing a tutorial titled &amp;ldquo;UE4 Tutorial: Add spline-meshes procedurally&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the YouTuber but this video, even though old, is very useful.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Video above is UE4 but things seen in it should work well in UE5 too. If some parts are hard to follow, I suggest giving a go to this one instead - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKIiWa19EMI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial - Splines - Spline Meshes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I remember using that at one point or another as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to move between modelling packages, as mentioned already, I imported in UE5 a Blueprint system I had made years prior. It&amp;rsquo;s one that I had started for some random UE4 project I could not even remember now &lt;em&gt;(tutorials for making similar blueprint are seen in the videos above)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I had carried it into my Orbital Gateway, (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;) where I had used it to scatter in line all of the metal platforms. It was also used to shape all of the big, vacuum like cables that are the kernel of the vision of that project. In that Gateway environment I had implemented some improvements into my initial spline Blueprint too. Things like being able to per instance basis pick different static mesh and different material to go onto the spline. It was a solution battle tested and as such I wanted to reuse it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos037.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot of the very first moment I dragged around the tube splines blueprint. I started with very thin and subtle ones. In the middle is the orb floating in the room. To the left of it is a tube that looks like cable. It starts from the upper part of the picture and crawls down the walls and reaches the middle, where the orb is.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in Blender and I made an initial tube that I kept higher in poly than I usually do (as in with extra edge loops). Using Unreal 5 now, unlike back in my previous projects that were Unreal 4, here I could afford higher polycount with the knowledge that all of my blocked out pieces will end up being Nanite meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tube I put into the spline Blueprint. Over the course of a few days I slowly build up bundles of large roots. Those were blockout so if any when taking a turn in the world were looked lowpoly, or any surface got distorted, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I wanted to block them out directly in UE5 but I still had in mind exporting the resulted meshes back into Blender in order to polish the visual slightly and UV map them by the end.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Same angle as before - the orb floats in the middle. Now both to the left, where there were thin cables, but also in the middle of the picture and close to the camera, are tubes that are much more thick and actually look like roots. They branch out in smaller and smaller slithering shapes. Image taken in Unreal 5.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to mention that I&amp;rsquo;ve not implemented control over the thickness of my splines on per spline point basis. As such I could not select a middle point of a root and scale it up to give it thickness. Instead I exported my uniformly thick roots from Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step to do that was to Merge Actors by selecting the spline - opening &amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo; from the Tools submenu - hitting &amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(you can see that in the image below)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would ask me a location to save the spline as a static mesh under the Project Directory. I then navigate to it in the Content Browser, right click on its icon and go to - Asset Actions - Export. That allows me to save the resulting mesh outside of UE5 as an *.fbx. I open that in Blender and I do my thickness scale up polish, UV polish, and subdivision to make it even smoother Nanite mesh. I import that back into UE5 and I replace the original spline blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 editor screenshot, showing an action in 3 steps. First open Tools submenu and select Merge Actors. Second select your spline blueprint in the world (see in the middle of the image). Third, use the newly opened Merge Actors window to save out the splines into ordinary Static Mesh. I suggest doing this by the end of your projects even on splines you like the visual of, as keeping it to splines increases draw calls immensely and will drag performance down. Saving out to Static Mesh bakes it down to one draw call.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paint over from Sophie the roots were incredibly large and impressive. I slowly build up mine to be large too. But I knew I will probably keep them smaller than her concept. I took that decision with the idea of keeping the focal point to be the orb. I thought that if I introduced roots that were very, very thick, they would draw viewers attention. Also I though that if indeed they were that big, I would need to figure out some set dressings and props to put on their surface, as to not leave them too bare, empty, boring and lacking detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;filling-up-the-empty-parts&#34;&gt;Filling up the Empty Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those roots looked at, we could take one step back and see the build up of set dressings in one corner of the environment. That way you could get a better perception of how all of the described details and props added up to build up the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos040.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image above shows a dirty looking Zbrush sculpt I made. It looks not that amazing in the Zbrush render, but once placed in the world with a tiling ground dirt material, to match the floors already there, it helped hide the 90 degrees I mentioned some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The close up from UE5 seen above. This time the pillars protruding from the bent walls are redone and have more square look. They also have intricate rune relieves on them. They are still flatly textured with placeholder materials.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then polished and revamped the pillars (image above). I wanted to give them better shape and texture. Something more realistic and intricate than the first draft. I also added pottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos042.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Shot identical to above. The at first empty spaces are now filled with roots that slither in all directions. The roots now have textures of barks too. There are flower foliage assets that have blue blooms and light up the scene in a magical, eerie glow.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can see the influence of the roots. I textured them using tiling materials from Megascans that I mixed in my own way using triplanar mapping in my UE5 shader. There is also a slight jump with me introducing some foliage and flower pods, but we will go into describing that process in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sophie Deschamps, who did the paint over seen in this entry, is a Level Artist at Ubisoft Montpellier. You can find and follow her work over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SophieDesArt&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we saw the scene fill up with props, dressings and more detail. We looked at using Blueprints spline systems for blocking out roots directly in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, however more going on during, and immediately after everything seen above. It was experiment and struggle with color that persisted for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted different color combinations where the roots flower blooms would light up the scene in blues, purples, reds, oranges. The orb would carry on that color in its fresnel too. Experimenting and switching between those colors went on for a while and then I got some ideas and help from another friend, just the way Sophie helped and inspired me with the roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we will look at that and how that influenced changing the orb in the middle for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos008-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-and-old-concepts&#34;&gt;Novel and Old Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second entry of this series I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to explore my references and early inspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at lots of artists, games, and photographs from all kinds of places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start a new art idea its good to look at plenty of references. You can source your idea or inspiration by mixing together existing paintings, photos, short stories, books and more. It&amp;rsquo;s also integral to look at real life photos. We aim for believable and realistic spaces and layouts (or at least I do in this project). That is even when our subjects are fantastical. As such parts of what we are about to create needs to be grounded on reality. Those parts need to have roots in what is already familiar in the viewers eyes. Then on top you sprinkle bit of the eerie, unknown, novel and bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-stage&#34;&gt;Current Stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the previous blog (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 01 - Beginning&lt;/a&gt;) after figuring out my Houdini orb and that it will be the center piece of the composition and the layout, I was at this stage of the scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos007.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3162&#34;
	height=&#34;1779&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot from the previous blog entry. A circular room with placeholder gray materials and strong orange glow. There is a fuzzy, liquid metal orb in the very middle. Around are pillars with ornate details on their tops. The walls have slight gaps for sci-fi-esque windows. There is a door that is slightly ajar and sunlight comes out of it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some further tweaks and added a little bridge platforms to connect the middle, circular platform to the outer edges of the room. In the very dead center, I cut a gap in order to place more &amp;ldquo;liquid metal&amp;rdquo; type of effect. I wanted to lead to the idea that perhaps in that basin in the middle of the room, there was an inactive substance. Few people, aliens, or some other creatures, enter the room and interact with that inactive substance. With their presence, it comes to life. It forms into the orb that then starts to float in the upper, middle point, space of the large room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you perhaps remember from the last entry, I really wanted to lead towards the idea of a ritual happening in this space. The creatures that enter the room bring the orb to life. They perhaps worship it, fear it, but are also astonished by it. Does it bring them energy? Food? Pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the relationship between these characters and this &amp;ldquo;inanimate&amp;rdquo; object that the next moment seems to come to life and be lively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start new scenes, or any other type of art, I usually make up a few sentences that form a story. The moment I have that I start to ask questions. Those questions are very much like the ones above. They help me refine and see more than what there is at first in my mind. They help me make a 3D space that is more believable, interesting and rich in story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is an exercise I think you should try yourself. Whenever you create a layout, ask yourself why its the way it is? When you place props, ask yourself why they are there and what their relation to other objects around them is? Ask how you can tie up one item to another so they look more coherent?&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 5 screenshot. Camera angle is the same as the image above. This time the strong orange glow in the left parts of the circular room is removed. The gray, placeholder materials have a cooler tone in general as well. The liquid metal orb from Houdini still floats in the middle of the room, but the central platform is now connected by little bridges. There is a basin cut in the middle too, with darkness inside it.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into more screenshots inside this 3D space, lets take a step back. As mentioned in the start of this entry, I want to include my references and early influences behind the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pureref.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PureRef&lt;/a&gt; to put all of my reference images in one place. I like using this piece of software because it&amp;rsquo;s very lightweight. Some people use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://miro.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; which has a similar idea but more annotation tools, sticky notes and other cool features. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that PureRef is easier on the RAM than having a webpage open or using the Miro desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my ref board I make sure to mix plenty of 2D art, 3D art but also real life photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos009.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;973&#34;
	height=&#34;744&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot overlooking my entire PureRef board. Lots of game screenshots, IRL photographs, concepts 2D artworks, 3D art and more is seen as tiny thumbnails.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;130&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;313px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ref boards, this one above I would rate as a relatively tiny. In most of my previous projects I&amp;rsquo;ve went through many more bundles of subjects and pictures and usually my boards expand much more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the creation of this scene I&amp;rsquo;ve been more controlled on the scope of the pieces I want to capture and create. As such that is also reflected in my ref board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to mention is that in the board above in some spots there are screenshots from the project itself. I like to screen cap where I am and put it right next to the reference in order to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-goals&#34;&gt;Initial Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets zoom in on some parts of the board above and see things further in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you about the artists that inspired me and credit them properly in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t personally know any of them but their work is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into this current ritual project I had spent a long while in another block out I was creating in Unreal Engine 5. It was the test scene where I transitioned from UE4 to UE5 and learned the intricacies of UE5s Nanite and Lumen. That project itself was in an &amp;ldquo;Early Preview&amp;rdquo; build of UE5 and had lots of issues and crashes. I never uploaded any screenshots from it, but at some point I might revisit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got my hands on Early UE5, official demos such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/a-first-look-at-unreal-engine-5&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Lumen in the Land of Nanite&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, then later &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/unreal-engine-5-early-access-available-now&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Valley of the Ancient&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/introducing-the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;City Sample (The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal ENgine 5 Experience)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; released. After reading official docs about Nanite and seeing the sculpts and works in those demos I put a goal for my project. That was to try and create sculpts that are as dense and details as some of the assets seen in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I came across the artworks in the image above. The left image, for example, is a sculpt by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/kDyQ0A&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Musaab Shukri&lt;/a&gt; done exactly for the UE5 demo &amp;ldquo;Valley of the Ancient&amp;rdquo;. Work for Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images to the right are concepts by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/VgbLzN&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zak Foreman&lt;/a&gt;. Those are again for the same demos. It depicts the visual fidelity and detail richness that Nanite could pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having realized these will be my visual fidelity goals, I set forward to find some real life photographs again. Some real spaces to get inspired from even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-diwan-i-khas-india&#34;&gt;The Diwan-i-Khas (India)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort), or Hall of Private Audiences is a location in India that I found lots of inspiration in. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see the resemblance in the intricate carvings here when compared to the previous UE5 demos artworks we saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos011.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Reference board screenshot consisting of photographs from Hall of Private Audience, Fatehpur Sikri, Uttar Pradesh, India. Images depict red stoneworks carvings that loop into intricate patterns and snake like elements. There is also a photo from - &amp;ldquo;Interior of Hodha Bai&amp;rsquo;s Palace, Fatehpur Sikri&amp;rdquo;.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;158&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;380px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very early blockouts I had, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really plan to head towards red stone look like the above. I still thought that the carvings are amazing reference for the sculpts I had yet to create. Also for any texture work that would go on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;circular-rooms&#34;&gt;Circular Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also pinned on my board some old, random photos of different circular rooms. I wanted a radial room after all, so I knew I should look at some from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos012.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Six photos put next to one another. The seventh is a game screenshot from &amp;ldquo;Shadow of the Colossus&amp;rdquo;. The others feature baroque and other architectural styles of circular rooms. Most have an opening in the ceiling that hosts set of windows that leak light in. Another photo is of a cave with god rays coming from open ceiling.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;144&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;346px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at different spaces that have above light leaking in and creating nice god rays. When showing my very early blockouts to some friends, they all mentioned &amp;ldquo;Shadow of the Colossus&amp;rdquo; as a game that has very impressive interior shots with lighting just like that one. I&amp;rsquo;ve not played the game myself yet, but I knew I had to put those nice screenshots from it on my moodboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;star-wars-jedi-fallen-order&#34;&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m creating a project I always have immediate influence from the games I am playing at the time. In this case I was playing through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order when creating parts of this environment. These screenshots from the game came into the board relatively late. Yet they (and the game) had a big influence on some of the decision making I took. It also helped me solve some visual issues I had and introduce more details like crack decals on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos013.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;131&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;316px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly looked at this section of the images, seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos014.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Lime-like green but in lots of parts cold gray cave walls. Old, sci-fi star wars structures with golden trims. Stalagmites that climb up in a fantastical, mushrooms-like way.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;159&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;383px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the decal work and base texturing here and found lots of inspiration. Later on I needed more props to populated my empty spaces with, and after being inspired by Jedi I created ground dirt scatter piece as well as a set of pots - some intact, some smashed into pieces. I will showcase these later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collaborators&#34;&gt;Collaborators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later through the project I had the pleasure to be inspired and helped by few more artists. Those are some of my friends and their influence here was direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hayleyrumbold.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hayley Rumbold&lt;/a&gt; joined me in the creation of this project as a collaborator and a Cinematic Artist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Phil Cockburn&lt;/a&gt; left me lots and lots of tips and feedback through it all too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to mention them now though I will show you the works they created and the amazing influence they had in more detail inside the next blog entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-assets&#34;&gt;Initial Assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having seen most of the reference images, we could step back now and see some of the first blockout shapes I made in Blender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos015.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos016.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1168&#34;
	height=&#34;935&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image of the same pieces seen above but now at an angle, in perspective, instead of a frontal, orthographic view like before.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;124&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;299px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the pieces I initially made and blocked out the scene. Some artists use Zbrush to block out pieces like that. I prefer to make these using a subdivision workflow, directly in Blender. I start by extruding a cube around and then beveling it in such a way that when I apply a Catmull-Clark subdivision on top, I get smooth, but not overly smooth shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make an absolute mess of the geometry. In some cases I insert lots of ngons (not seen in many obvious places here, but I still do). When using Catmull-Clark I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about my geometry flow mainly because I know the algorithm will make all of it into quads by the end when applied. If those quads follow awful edge loops, I frankly don&amp;rsquo;t mind. I don&amp;rsquo;t because I know that what I am making is then directly going into Zbrush. Once in there I will Dynamesh to get my to a density of geometry I like. When I do that any bad edge loops and flows gets retopologized to something much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos019.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;125&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;301px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a resulting topology (image above). One that actually is pretty clean compared to some of the descriptions I wrote above, that happen most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the walls I later duplicated a few times in Blender:&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;90&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;217px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To then as described above take into Zbrush:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos018.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The four pieces seen in the image above, now inspected in Zbrush. They are sculpted and each has unique cracks and damages, while one remains mostly intact.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;132&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;318px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I refined my geometry, made topology that can hold good brush stokes and then detailed on top to get me to more finalized assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this all is an exercise in Nanite, I was not scared to be dense in topology and detail. I tried to make silhouettes rich in detail where the cracks and damages are. In some of the other wall pieces, I stamped stencil details in the form of writings, symbols and ritualistic stone carvings. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to rely on baking those down onto a lower poly, but instead use Decimation Master in Zbrush to get me to a lower dense poly, suitable for Nanite (as in being 150-200k tris. Even though Nanite could totally handle keeping some of the sculpts at 2-3m tris, it proved to be pointless and not add much detail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;platform-sculpts&#34;&gt;Platform Sculpts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos020.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Three props seen in a Blender screenshot. First one is a large, circular platform. Second is a pie cut modular piece. Third one is a bent wall.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;431px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My platform in the very center of the middle, I kept as one big shape. That is the first prop seen in the Blender screenshots above. Keeping it one big shape might sound a bit insane because it might be incredibly hard to keep high texel density even on 4k textures. That&amp;rsquo;s given how large the entire piece is. As such I briefly considered making a pie cut 1/4 of it, to then rotate by copying 3 more times and getting me the entire circle. I decided against that mainly for one reason: I knew I will create a dense Nanite mesh. As such I knew that most of my detail will sit in the geometry itself. If on top a slightly lower density albedo texture went, I decided it would not be a problem. Sculpting details on a platform this large on top, would also be quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the outer ring platform that wraps around that same platform, I decided to use the &amp;ldquo;pie cut&amp;rdquo; approach. I did that mainly because with its radius going further out the main platform, its cover area increased. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t scared of the texel density (though at that point I should have been) but more of the chore that sculpting such a giant piece would turn into, if I were to keep the entire ring a unique prop, instead of a pie cut. As such I made it into a &amp;ldquo;modular&amp;rdquo; cut and duplicated it many times in the scene, rotating it about, building up the rooms floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos021.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Zbrush red matcap screenshot showing the circular platform now sculpted on top. It has brick-like details but also lots of swirling circle motives that give it a sci-fi, alien look.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;225&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;542px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image was the first sculpt I did on the platform right after I took it into Zbrush. Going back to that talk about &amp;ldquo;familiar vs novel&amp;rdquo; right at the start of this blog, with this sculpt I later started to worry that the swirling, circular motives looked too alien. They are nice in an &amp;ldquo;alien crop circles&amp;rdquo; kind of way. But are they perhaps too abstract for this scene? Making everything look too smooth, too fudged and &lt;em&gt;non-concrete&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos022.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Substance Painter screenshot. Shows the same platform as above, but now the sculpt is different and has more &amp;ldquo;brick&amp;rdquo; appearance. To the right is the UV view. All of the brick details are actual geometry as this is a Nanite mesh and I wanted to keep it more dense.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;178&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;429px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I went back and sculpted it once more. This time around keeping a certain array of circles towards the middle, but in the outer parts giving a more structured, brick appearance. Seen in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scene-shots&#34;&gt;Scene Shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the platform in the context of the scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos023.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3162&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot showing the middle platform. It has a cut in the middle that has a basin full of darkness and starry-looking texture. Little, untextured bridges at the sides lead to the outer platform radius.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the old version. Below is the new one. I also put in some scene lights recolors and texture recolors to give everything a more controlled and realistic appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos024.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 5 screenshot. Camera angle is the same as above but now the platform sculpt is more refined. The little bridges are textured. The lighting in the scene is less orange and red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoomed in towards the middle, we can inspect the platform and the &amp;ldquo;darkness basin&amp;rdquo; in the middle too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos025.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1007&#34;

		alt=&#34;The middle platform and the basic cut in the middle, seen through a zoomed in camera.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;95&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;230px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the gaps of the bricks I put in flat planes. On those I added a liquid metal texture. At some point I was imagining the idea of cutting little canals going from the middle basin towards the outsides of the platform. In those canals liquid full of white stars would flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought its an interesting idea but I later abandoned it as I was worried that after introducing some other details on the outskirts of the scene, having black and white, high contrast, liquid in the cracks of the platforms proved to introduce visual clutter. It was making the scene fall a part more than it was tying it together or the novelty of the idea was worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next blog post we will look at the upper parts of the scene. We will inspect all of the wall and dome pieces seen in the Blender screenshots above which I used to create the higher parts of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also revamped the pillars, just the way I reworked the middle platform above. I gave them more structure, carved runes and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed seeing all of this,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 10 - Recolored, Depth Fade, Stencils</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/orbital010.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 10 - Recolored, Depth Fade, Stencils" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;recolor&#34;&gt;Recolor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick update with some recoloring and some other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/orbital010.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle. Compared to the previous post this time around the atmosphere and the color in the air are revamped. Most of the colors are in blue and teal, blue, green-ish ting. The only other color is of gold and yellow lights dotted around.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original concept had blue tint while my vision of it so far was mostly warm gray. (If you would like a reminder of how the original concept looks, you can find it in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;blog one of the series&lt;/a&gt;). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to follow the concept word for word, but I could not stop but feel I might be missing out by not trying the colors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such after some experimentation I landed on the colors you see above. I liked those quite a bit more than the original warm tomes I had going on. I then went into trying to clean up the portal / event horizon VFX even more. The previous one was too emissive and noisy for my liking and I though it was too busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another angle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00227.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Side angle showcasing the cylinder device in a spot where the right portal is on but the left one is malfunctioning and off. On the left one, that was in red lights last time, we now see a tint towards white and yellow lighting.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see I cut out the concept of the red, warning like colors. I still want to convey the idea of the gate being partially broken and malfunctioning, but maybe going for red and alarming colors was too obvious and easy. Sure it worked out but I think there are more creative ways to do it, I just have to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gamut-analysis&#34;&gt;Gamut Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/color-gamut-peter-dimitrov-cap073.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1524&#34;
	height=&#34;528&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two screenshots. Left is the old view of the scene, with red lights. The right side is the new view, with more yellow and blue lights. Next to each of those screenshot is a gamut look analysis, breaking down the colors and showing them onto a circular color selection with the colors used highlighted. When looking at the version with mostly yellow and blues, the color selection is clearly much more controlled and limited.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;288&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;692px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gamut is much more limited in colors now and I think the end result is quite more harmonic composition wise. You can see a reading of it in the picture above.
I added some cut and exposed wires but I have yet to try adding some sparks and other animated VFX. That might help sell the malfunctioning concept without the use of the red color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baking-normal-details&#34;&gt;Baking Normal Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I went into making some more pipes for the background. I also made a depth fade shader that gives a force field like effect where some of the pipes go through. Then I went into creating some hard surface stencils and baked details to use and stamp in Substance Painter. I modeled them in Maya and then baked normals of them in Substance Designer. I took those normals to use in Painter. I have just a few going on now but I&amp;rsquo;m going to make more in order to cover some of the otherwise empty areas on the panel surfaces of the portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 06 - Metals and Textures</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Quick update with a latest preview of how the scene is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dived into UV mapping and some materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/orbital006.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

		alt=&#34;Main UE4 camera shot, showing the portal cylinder. Material and texture work can be seen, with the greebles now having metallic shine while cables appear rubber and blue and there are some golden trims scattered too.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the panels still don&amp;rsquo;t have textures. I went with silver/chromium look tied up with some gold and golden trims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;panels&#34;&gt;Panels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I managed to go through four of the panels and texture them. I laid them out on the same UV texture set so they share bitmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not completely happy with the detail, noises and colors on them, but I&amp;rsquo;m setting up everything with smart materials so I should be able to easily tweak all of them. I just need to UV map the rest tomorrow. Fun. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View of just the mapped panels plus the gate frame:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background I started with a trim sheet so I can easily introduce some patterns later on. Though arguably it will need some geometry there too as to not be too flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll need to work more in order to balance the amount of detail on each panel through their textures. I want some panels to have golden elements too but I am going slow in order not to overwhelm it. Also I want to map and texture to the existing level the other 5-6 panels and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start trying the same changes uniformly on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to bake some normal stencils and decals that I will then stamp directly on some of the empty surfaces for some extra detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any comments are appreciated,&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember the scene from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, you would probably notice that it looks completely different. That is, looking at the atmosphere, at least. The layout is more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mist&#34;&gt;Mist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this idea, of having mist just above the surface, since the very start. I purposely postponed it until now, though, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get crazy with tweaking volumetric fog settings, alpha and fog cards and putting crazy amount of time in it, whilst not having the basic layout figured out or any of the props ready. But now, when nearly all of the props are ready, I had the time to sit down and work on vapor and smog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone wanting to recreate this, the ground mist is just a very large &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particle Emitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Its tied up to a &lt;em&gt;Clouds texture&lt;/em&gt;, pans a tiny bit, has a pretty short lifespan and is spawn cylindrical. After that its just a matter of tweaking your &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volumetric Fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; settings in your &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exponential Height Fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; volume. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure the guy in Epics &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd7-rTzfmCo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(14th minute mark)&lt;/em&gt; about Volumetric Fog in the Engine quickly recreates something very similar. The only part I added myself, is how I placed it in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s just below the surface of my Landscape. And that&amp;rsquo;s how I made it look like ground mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov15.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stained-glass&#34;&gt;Stained Glass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, very important addition since last time, is the Stained Glass material that I created. It&amp;rsquo;s made from scratct in Substance Designer. What you see here is version 2.0, as the first one I created, I abandoned after a bit, as I though its shape was too simple. It had a diamond pattern going for it, and I wanted something more intricate looking than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov16.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Angled, closer shot of the cathedral. The tower and the right wing of it have a strong, mostly purple stained glass in intricate hues and patterns.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main approach to it was creating a base pattern and then picking up different areas of it and applying a few individual &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flood Fills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Each Flood Fill is turned to Color and then the hue, saturation and lightness of each shape that the Fill has picked up is randomised. The tricky part was giving it a shining look afterwards, in the Engine. If you look at just the material &amp;ldquo;ball&amp;rdquo; in Substance, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much on its own. To give it that emissive look, I masked just a small portion of the whole patter. I applied another Flood Fill (by now third) and gave it sharp, stained masked noise with a Slope Blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov17.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up shot of the stained glass. Circular motives that overlap into one another. Each different circle is colored in a different hue, raging from a lime, dark, cold green to an electric but warm red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m particularly happy with this approach, and it gave me one thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate and wasn&amp;rsquo;t aiming to achieve. If you look at the texture up close in Unreal (the screenshot above), the emission mask is distinct and clear (white magenta bits). As you start going further away from it, though, the Engine shrinks the texture quality a bit, which blurs the emissive pixels. Those pixels then, start to work together with the Bloom settings of the scene, and fill the whole glass surface with a dark, electric, blue color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/28_peter_dimitrov_neon_gravestones.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from Substance Designer showing node set up that creates the above described colored circles for the stained glass. The screenshot is focused on &amp;ldquo;Flood Fill&amp;rdquo; nodes.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;169&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;407px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As I described, you can feed an outline of your pattern towards a Flood Fill. You can then use a Flood Fill To Color to randomise the HSL of each generated shape. You can see all of that in the screenshot above.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are making a strained texture of your own, I would suggest experimenting with emissive mask, but also pay attention to your Bloom settings in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Processing Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A good combination of both, always makes for exciting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pattern of the texture, I was in parts inspired by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/blogs/steppenwolf/306A/substance-designer-random-things-3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matthias Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; techniques, which he shares over in his blog. Check that out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things are ready by now. I still have a few objects to put textures to. The boxes that you can still see are placeholder for hopefully some statues of something looking like a weeping angel. I want one or two of those, to contrast the very straight shapes of the rest of the headstones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also still working on the details of the main gate that you can see in the very first shot in this post. Facade details around the big window too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this project has been quite a fun journey. I think this will be my last post about it though. As long as it goes about approach explanation at least. My next one &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;hopefully&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; will be a gallery to showcase the final result. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on the video, to showcase the casket as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Casket as seen from a few posts ago, as I have a feeling some of you probably don&amp;rsquo;t even remember it. It&amp;rsquo;s still here! Going to animate it for a final video.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I started this project a few months ago, is my university. As such I&amp;rsquo;ll be submitting it as a thesis in about a week now. So that&amp;rsquo;s the deadline by which you will hopefully see the final result as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those of you who you stuck with me through the whole journey, and read all of the previous entries (about eight), I want to say thanks. I hope you found them useful and intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
