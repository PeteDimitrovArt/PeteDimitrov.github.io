		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the UE4 prototype. Angle and subject is similar to the shots in the previous posts. Here, however, the visuals and tiles are more finalized. Big sun star to the left, throwing aggressive light on the gray tiles to the right. The light is more defined and the &amp;ldquo;shadow&amp;rdquo; areas are now much more obvious.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last post we mentioned the most important Blueprints we need in order to have actual gameplay. They do build the win/lose condition, but we still need one more very important element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need what I call right now, and am going to refer to, with the word “blocks”. The blocks are the pieces that go on the environment to cast shadows here and there. The blocks are what the player is in control of, as I said way back in the first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tetris-pieces&#34;&gt;Tetris Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game, I have tiles, that put together create the map/surface area. Then, on top of those, go the blocks. They fit together perfectly in slots, as I need it to be visually explicit where a player is allowed to place and where they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_022.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Maya screenshot of a scene with an Unreal dummy seen from far. Next to the mannequin are different style of tiles - hex, triangular, beveled and more.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;557px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First “sketch” of the shapes I did in Maya. It was a quick test to see what shape could work the best. At that point in my mind I already knew I wanted one shape repeated many times like a tile, but I still was not certain what that shape would be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_023.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;142&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;342px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I did anything, I had a quick sketch, that does not look very impressive, that I made in Photoshop. It was more of a guide for the mood, that was assuring me I am going in the direction I want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could probably see that the image I produced above, was what inspired me to go towards a blue starry sky, overall dark tone, and a very bright sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also sort of see the path, illustrated in blue, and the idea of going from point A to point B as a main objective in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sun&#34;&gt;Sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had figured out the visual of the tiles, and the Sun next to them, the first draft was a hollow, holographic looking star. Although I said I don’t have plenty of time to create textures and shaders (thus the tiles are textureless) I still needed to make sure the Sun has a texture. The Sun needs one, because it is a main game mechanic element. We need to be able to tell, visually, that it’s big, that it’s hot, and that it is potentially dangerous. It can’t simply be hollow. That is when I went into making a texture and some basic animation for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My reference sheet (or what others call a mood board) for the Sun. You can see the giant Sun from Destiny 2 on a few different screenshots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_025.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Unreal 4 screenshot showing 3 spheres colored in reds and oranges. First has magma like texture. Second one has a &amp;ldquo;stepped&amp;rdquo;, lowpoly and holographic look. Third one is a combination of one and two.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;429px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final visuals of the sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun is created from two spheres that go inside each one. The outer one is a low poly, with a Fresnel Shader applied to it. It gives it the triangular holographic look, that flickers with a subtle animation. Inside of it is a proper texture, unlit Shader, that has an animated normal and some glow too. Both materials can be controlled for a change in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_026.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;715&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot similar to the previous one. Three spheres but now each has different color. First one is green, second is a discordant combination of purple and blue and third one is overpowering yellow with splash of tiny oranges. &#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;429px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different colors of the stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some levels of the game could have multiple suns different locations. In that case I can have selection of colors so each is unique, more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-block-pieces&#34;&gt;Back to the Block Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What those needed was a “placement system” Blueprint. It was good that I knew exactly how I wanted that. That’s, again, thanks to the traditional RTS games. What I ended up making is simple in words, but more complex in Blueprints. It’s a system where you can click on a block to place it, it becomes semi-transparent and red (again with the help of a Fresnel function). If you point to a tile, that is marked with a Boolean that says “True” for “Is this tile Place-able on?”, then the transparent color turns green. It also lets you place it on top if you click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system for that is quite complex and I genuinely would have to do a few posts to find a way to explain it like a tutorial. Something, for which sadly there is no time right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also have to thank my brother, Miroslav Dimitrov, who is a programmer and helped me figure out the logic of a few things I needed to do, so I could properly turn them into Blueprints. I am sure he did not find it as amusing and fun as I did, mainly because he writes in code, has no idea how Blueprints work, and had to just guide me and watch me struggle on my own with Unreal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guide for anyone that might want to make a system like that is to look into &lt;strong&gt;Get Hit Result Under Cursor by Channel&lt;/strong&gt;. That is basically a line trace that goes where the location of the mouse cursor is. After you use that, do a check to what object the mouse is pointing at, and then have your IFs to change color, check if placement is possible and et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_027.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1280&#34;
	height=&#34;711&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the game showing the tiles and a sun next to them. The mouse cursor is hovered over a specific tile that has a triangular gap inside. With the mouse being there, a holographic, green, obstacle tile shows on top. It&amp;rsquo;s an indication that the tile is a valid placement. (like in an RTS)&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;180&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;432px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pointing the mouse at valid slot tiles makes the block green. Red for not being able to place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blocks-visuals&#34;&gt;Blocks Visuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to mention, that given the blocks are so important and the player interacts with them, it would make sense to have textures and proper interesting models for them. I would love to do that, but for now just a different color will have to do. I will go back to it and maybe model out something, given that after I completed all of the important Blueprints I need, and I make a few playable levels, I am left with some free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research on how the blocks could potentially look just randomly walked through my door one day. Or more like not my door, but the door of the university building I am in during classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful statues, courtesy of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cherylvollorceramics/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those intricate ceramic statues, painted with acrylic on top (if I remember correctly) are created by &lt;em&gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/em&gt;. I met her randomly in the first showcase room here at UCLAN in Preston. To get to the studio of our class, you walk through an entrance, small “hall” of sorts, where every week different art displays are put on. That’s where Cheryl had the exhibit of her statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I first saw them, I suddenly imagined some of the maps of my game to be like that. A weird, alien environment, with peculiar crystal formations and colorful blocks that are in a juxtaposition with the dull monotone colors of the surface. The player could pick up those blocks and move them around. This whole thought came to me way before I had done any prototyping and it just sparkled a lot of excitement in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Cheryl, who was amazing, and let me use the visuals of her statues in any game I created or for any research I would need. Thanks again for that, Cheryl!&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another picture of ceramic sculptures. This time around not only is the ground in whites and blues/purples but the protruding parallelepipeds also have those colors. They are also angled in an uneasy fashion, as opposed to the first picture where they were nearly perfectly upright.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Another photo of the statues. By &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cherylvollorceramics/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I said, we will sadly have to wait to see if I get some free time to “upgrade” the visuals of my blocks with anything remotely similar to those pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you found this visual research intriguing. Next we will look into the first playtest with actual living people, that my game saw! Woah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly update this entry to mention that there was no &amp;ldquo;next time&amp;rdquo;. I wrapped up the project by adding a few extra levels and having it all then playable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will admit to you though, that the game prototype was behind, priority wise, on the list of my other works, given I had at the time focused on crafting an Environment Art portfolio to try and find my break into the industry later that same 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such I put most of my attention in &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo; (both of which you can read in detail about by using the &amp;ldquo;Category&amp;rdquo; buttons to the right whilst on the main page of this blog).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did, however, create a &amp;ldquo;trailer&amp;rdquo; for the game, as part of the course. I never got to writing another entry to these blogs and showing it there, but here it is for you:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;game-trailer&#34;&gt;Game Trailer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgjCF3PDWnI&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No mention of &amp;ldquo;vampires in space&amp;rdquo;. Kind of a missed opportunity, 2019 Peter! Instead just &amp;ldquo;Astronauts&amp;rdquo;? Oh well&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see in the trailer that I tried to keep it humorous and easy going, as I thought then, and still believe that would be the right course of action for the game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2019 20:36:00 +0000</pubDate>

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots showcasing the path with the unit (astronaut) on it. There are red ground textures in this one, but I stepped back and returned to a more clear visual style late, mainly because I wont have much time to work on visuals. Its all about Blueprints and game mechanics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;important-blueprints&#34;&gt;Important Blueprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to become a playable game, I need three crucial elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is the camera. Unreal Engine 4 does start with a few presents of options for camera. You can have first- or third-person instantly set up with proper Blueprints. In this case, though, I need a system for a camera that is more close to the properties of one in an RTS game. I want the player to see everything from above, at a sort of isometric view. That preset does not exists and sadly I will have to build my own, from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two is the path, on which the player unit is going to walk. The player themself are not exactly that unit, they are not the astronaut. They don&amp;rsquo;t control the astronaut. At least not in the sense where the player moves them around with inputs like arrow or WASD keys. Instead, on the screen UI there is a button. It says “Walk”. The player presses that and the Astronaut starts walking along the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/chromosphere_pd_016.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from an UE4 widget / ui and ux editor. There is a red text block and a button with text &amp;ldquo;walk&amp;rdquo; on it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;219&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;526px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walk button as seen in the game, next to the Health Pool display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three is a Sun blueprint. In it would be stored the information of when the player should take damage. In this case, I’ve created a array of elements. I reference those and then cast a line trace between those elements (in this case, they are spotlights) and the Astronaut. If in-between those there is any element blocking the trace, then I can come to a conclusion that the Astronaut must be in shadow, and thus should take no damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all of this, lets look at each one individually once more, but this time more in detail when it comes to the logic and the blueprints themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera&#34;&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/chromosphere_pd_017.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;395&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;950px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve created my own Pawn blueprint. In it I’ve placed a camera that moves together with the movement of a ball. The ball is set to be invisible, with no collision and through the Blueprints I move the ball around. The camera follows it and thus becomes functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four ways to control that movement. Three are quite simple and the 4th is a bit more complicated. First and second are controls through the arrow keys of the keyboard and through WASD. I’ve mapped those to axis movement input in the Project Settings, and then I’ve called those keybindings in the blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third way of movement is panning. You click right mouse button with the cursor of the mouse anywhere on the screen and you drag around - the map drags with the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth was the most complicated one. It’s just like the one in a traditional real-time strategy game. You point the mouse at the edges of the screen and the camera moves in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/chromosphere_pd_018.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;One of the previous screenshots showing the land. On top there are photoshop annotations. It divides the screen on X and Y (up and down &amp;#43; left and right axis).&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get that working, I am calling a function in the Blueprints that is there by default. It is called &lt;em&gt;Get Mouse Position on Viewport&lt;/em&gt;. See, the screen is composed out of numbers. Sort of mapped in X and Y coordinates. Just like the illustration I’ve included above. The functions returns those X and Y and I check their value. I create 4 cases, sort of mapping the screen in 4 sectors. Or 5 I presume. One is the very middle where nothing happens. The 4 important sectors are those in the edges. If X and Y correspond to numbers that are in those 4 sectors, I then know the mouse is there and next I move it in the correct direction.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Blueprint editor screenshot. There is a &amp;ldquo;Pan Camera&amp;rdquo; custom node that leads into &amp;ldquo;Get Mouse Position on Viewport&amp;rdquo; that then gets split into a Sequencer Node into 4 cases. Each case then goes into a respective IF branch of == (-&amp;#43;) X Dir or == (-&amp;#43;) Y Dir.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of the blueprint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images hosted here are for some reason tiny, and I know that you probably wont be able to see very well each individual node. But I believe you can follow the logic following the colors of the links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Edit: this was initially hosted in another web where images are smaller. One above is bigger, yet I know its actually still not easy to follow what is seen, so I apologize for not having a higher resolution for you.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything goes in, running on an &lt;strong&gt;Event Tick&lt;/strong&gt;. After all, I need to check where the mouse is all the time. Going in, it then plays a Sequence hooked up to 4 IFs (branches). You can already guess, that those 4 ifs control the test where the mouse is. In a case an if branch is true, it sets a value of 2 Float variables I’ve created. &lt;strong&gt;XDir&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;YDir&lt;/strong&gt;. I set those two to -1 or 1. And with their respectable combination, it yells 4 results to where the mouse could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have enough time to take screenshots of each node and showcase it well. Or to explain the logic node by node. As this is not really a detailed tutorial. But I do hope talking about the logic behind this blueprint served to be of some help to anyone reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The spline system seen in the Engine. The visuals are outdated and the shaders I am using look kind of weird. Still you can see the system demonstrated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a similar spline system set up, you can follow &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUxM0NDWRY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Mine is identical, with the difference that I’ve also included a player mesh that moves on top of it (Astronaut).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part about this system is the fact that the spline, with its points that I can add, remove and move around dynamically, allows me the freedom to set up multiple levels. It’s like a sandbox system ready to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invisible line traces are cast all the time to detect collision. In this image, I’ve made them visible for illustration purposes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line traces are cast from a function called &lt;strong&gt;Line Trace by Channel&lt;/strong&gt;. Its pretty straightforward to use and I am sure you can find plenty of resources about it. Its &amp;ldquo;Start&amp;rdquo; is Sun, and the &amp;ldquo;End&amp;rdquo; is the Astronaut BP Actor (the mannequin). Small tweak I’ve done is that the start is not just the Sun, but its an array of Spotlight Elements. That way I can place a spotlight anywhere and have it referenced as the starting point and thus have more control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be it for now, hope you found this insightful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next post we are gonna explore some thoughts on models, visual language, props and the map itself. Stay tuned,&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-game&#34;&gt;A New Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been into the making and prototyping of a game from scratch the past bit less than a year. The topic of it was open, and it was up to me to decide what exactly I want to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go into what the game is about, its story, genre and so on, I want to spend a few lines talking about my initial few other ideas. The ones I went through before deciding to go with the one that I am working on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rules-so-to-say&#34;&gt;The Rules. So to say.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I making the game? What are the requirements towards it? Well, for one, making games is fun. I am an artist and a designer, so why not apply all of my skills in one place and make a whole game? But there is more than that obviously. I need this game for university. This is one of my graduation projects for BA (Hons) in Games Design at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uclan.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/games-design-ba&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, Preston, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as rules go at uni, well there is a big and important one. I have to develop everything on my own, from scratch. And that is what dictates the strongest the reasoning to why exactly I chose this idea out of the total three I had initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-idea-01&#34;&gt;Initial Idea 01&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Rupture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_002.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Rupture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a game idea I came up with together with my brother, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-dimitrov-17592a107/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Miroslav Dimitrov&lt;/a&gt;, in the distant past year of 2013. The project was created in the span of a single weekend and a bit. 72 hours. For the famous game jam website &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ludum Dare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. You can see our initial submission over at our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ludumdare.com/resources/archive/compo/?u=ludum-dare-27/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the game was simple; you are a time traveller, who created a time-travel machine. You go on said machine and start to teleport through different time dimensions, going in the past, future and so on. Though the very first teleportation though, something goes wrong. The machine breaks down and pieces of it spill around you. Ten seconds pass and you are suddenly teleported somewhere else. At every teleportation you can go around and collect random bits of metal and machine pieces. Those increase your score. When the ten seconds go through, you must be back on the machine. If you are not at it, it teleport itself without you and you are suddenly stranded. You lose the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot 01 - The player finds themself stranded in 2nd Century. Somewhere in Northern Thrace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the game was kind of elegant in its simplicity. And as it is with most nice things, it was born out of prerequisite, not out of pure wit. The condition that birthed it was the rule of the game jam. Its theme which participant were bound to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme read:
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_004.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I though it might be cool if I were to recreate the game. 3D low-poly art with some interesting light effects and particles. Assembled in Unreal Engine 4, programmed there with Blueprints. Props modelled in Maya, texturing in Substance Painter and Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to back up the idea, we really did get quite a good score at the competition back in 2013, proving that there is potential in the concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_005.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;170&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;408px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We placed number &lt;em&gt;69&lt;/em&gt; for the theme. Out of a total of &lt;em&gt;2213&lt;/em&gt; game entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really though the idea is simple and I would be able to recreate it and even improve onto it for the one year I have at uni to develop everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that sort of stopped me is the fact that I am an artist and designer, but not much of a programmer. I can do simple visual scripting in Blueprints (which came out to not be very simple in the current state of the project, but we shall see that in the next posts), but I can’t really code anything complex in any language. And I wanted to be able to do justice to things like spawning different mechanical parts and elements into the world, using some algorithm a bit more complex and elegant than what I can sadly do on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to my teachers and they said its fine if I have some help from outside. With the programming that is. As long as I keep all of the art and design elements/mechanics completely from me. And so I knew I could bring my brother to the project, and have him program a few algorithms for me. I decided to leave it to that though, and explore more ideas and maybe stumble across something I can execute more independently, just on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-idea-02---running-out-of-space&#34;&gt;Initial Idea 02 - Running Out of Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model in Maya that I created as an initial proof of concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this game I didn’t have a working title, but again more of a working theme. Again from Ludum Dare &lt;em&gt;(you can probably already guess I sort of really like that event and game jam website :P)&lt;/em&gt;. The theme was &lt;strong&gt;Running Out of Space&lt;/strong&gt;. And it sort of aligned with some ideas and notes I had been doing prior to going in the jam. The jam was held during a weekend in August, 2018. We didn’t manage to create anything playable or to submit anything, but it was still a nice exercise of generating ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial notes and a quick sketch I did back then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_008.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;483px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial camera view I tested. The game would be a 2.5 side view, where in 3D space you assign units what to do. You gather and manage resources and space people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some additional ideas that I though would fit perfect into this game concept. But there was one thing - in a staggering opposition with everything I said previously with the &lt;strong&gt;Time Rupture&lt;/strong&gt; game idea. It’s the fact that, if I were to make this game, a sim in genre, where you deploy all kinds of units around the ship, it would require really importantly on one important thing. That thing is artificial intelligence. I would need a good AI. One that would control the units and make them move around the ship. It would let them execute the tasks the player has given them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that was an idea more complex in programming than anything else I had though about. And even though I am keeping it in my records as a project I might go back to on day, it was by no chance appropriate for university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-idea-03---light-is-dangerous&#34;&gt;Initial Idea 03 - Light is Dangerous.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Light is Dangerous&amp;rdquo; later turned into &amp;ldquo;Chromosphere&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_009.jpg&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;114&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;275px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down to think about a third idea. This time around the main condition: the idea needs to be simple. Execution should be possible just on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had nothing to get me started and that’s why I took this screenshot you see up there. Its a near final round of voting for a theme. A theme for another Ludum Dare. Not sure which one or the date. But it still listed 16 themes and I though that is enough ideas to get me started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took and combined &amp;ldquo;Shadows&amp;rdquo; together with &amp;ldquo;Light is dangerous&amp;rdquo;. Ye, they both kind of sound like a cliche, but I though it might be fun to explore what I can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I came up with was a puzzle game. One where you, the player are not in control of a character. Instead you are in control of the environment in which the protagonist is. The character is stranded on a piece of land. Maybe somewhere in space. Next to them is a giant sun. A star. It emits light so hot, that if the character steps in it for far too long, they starts taking damage and then burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial sketch and notes of the idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_011.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow note in pic above reads: &amp;ldquo;You are a spaceman&amp;hellip; who is also a vampire. You are in open space and you&amp;rsquo;ve lost your helmet. Help the vampire get to the end and retrieve their helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the side read: &amp;ldquo;Goal is to retrieve a space suit helmet. - Goofy, easy-going story.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Harder levels could have multiple units (spacemen), who walk different paths at the same time. Makes it more complex.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trigger pressure plates on the paths that manipulate the environment on the go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Specific part of the path goes to night? Day-night cycle?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the first page you can read where I took inspiration for the idea: during the summer, just before going back to uni, I build myself a new desktop PC. I needed a powerful GPU (I used an integrated one before that) in order to handle all of the graphic 3D work I was about to start doing in Unreal (for stuff like this project). The video card I got came with a free copy of Destiny 2. I hadn’t played it before that, but given how gorgeous and heavy in graphics it looked, I had to try my new GPU on it. I sunk in quite a few hours playing it and had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one particular level of its missions that stuck with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;destiny&#34;&gt;Destiny&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that mission you are on a ship just past Mercury, right next to the Sun. At some point you have to get to a specific part that is locked. You are forced to go outside the spaceship and walk on its exterior. That walk stuck with me because it had the mechanic where you had to stay in the shadow bits of the map. It was super simple and wasn’t challenging as a puzzle or anything. The game is a FPS shooter after all. But there was something really beautiful in the giant sun that you could stare right into too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I though about a few systems that I need to have to get the game working. Then decided they are not too complex for me to execute in just mere Blueprints, no programming language. That is when I got on board with it and started developing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first proof of concepts I did quickly in Unreal 4 back then.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks of developing after that got me to this visual style and a few systems in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_014.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1280&#34;
	height=&#34;720&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same angle screenshot as before. Now the sun sphere is filled in with proper material shader and looks more like a surface of a star. On the gray tiles to the right now there is also a pink path.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk about how I got to this stage and what my blueprints are in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you find reading this interesting. Keep tuned,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
