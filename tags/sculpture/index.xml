&lt;p&gt;At the end of the previous blog entry we looked in detail at the center platform and its sculpt. I showed how the mesh underwent a few changes, getting it from alien crop circles appearance to a more ordinary brick and pavement look. You could revisit those screenshots over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, slightly skip over looking at the lower walls of the environment and what I did with their sculpts. I also mentioned that we should look at the upper parts of the scene too, and briefly talk about the wall pieces, windows, and dome elements there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos025.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Lower ground camera screenshot that is pointed towards the upwards parts of the scene. It reveals the orb floating in the middle of the scene, bathed in light (in the shape of alpha card God Rays). Above the orb one can see the circumference of the initial lower room shrink inwards. On the walls of that are windows cut in the form of circles. On the very top, the ceiling is dome shaped. It opens up like a flower flooding further with daylight the otherwise dark interior. Unreal Engine 5 screenshot.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roof-blockout&#34;&gt;Roof Blockout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, in this screenshot seen below we can see my initial blockout of the ceiling. My approach to putting the place together was as follows: I blocked out the lower levels walls. I put in the middle platform so the orb is centered, floating on it. I added little bridges and a bunch of pillars. I then added one upper level of walls - the ones where the circumference of the room shrinks once for the first time. It creates a dome like appearance where the pillars are. The walls above get to host some circle cut windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had all of this blocked out, I set on to sculpt further all of the above described assets. After sculpting them I did an initial texturing pass. Even then, when I still had no roof, I knew I want to create a dome appearance on the upper ceilings. I knew I want to open up a tall space around there and not end up the celling ending close to the orb, thus making a claustrophobic space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew and was planning all of that I had still not made most of the blockout upper assets and ceiling pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead once I had done the first sculpting and texturing pass of the lower levels, and once I had seen it work well and I liked it, I set off to continue the missing ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos026.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Image crop looking at the upper parts of the scene. Shows the dome ceiling building up few levels of shapes and silhouettes. The top one is the most intricate one, with flower and fractal elements. All of the upper parts have placeholder, gray, materials while the lower parts are textured. UE5 image.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;116&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;279px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is how the upper levels looked - in mid-blockout - when I was testing out the shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were I testing out the visual and silhouette of the shapes themselves but I also was engaged fully into looking at something else too: their use with light. I wanted to create interesting patterns at the very top that then would flood the lower parts of the environment in light that leaves spellbinding, exciting shadow silhouettes. Here light itself was my main attention and my main &amp;ldquo;asset&amp;rdquo;. It dictated what was going to happen with the sculpture pieces. Light inspired me in the making of the flower-like opening on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;564px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having figured what pieces work and what pieces I like from the initial Blender blockouts, I set off to take some of them inside Zbrush. The modular building pieces that I liked I retopologized in Zbrush using Dynamesh. I then further sculpted and polished details on top. Some I duplicated multiple times and shattered in different ways, deriving me extra dressings and details.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;347px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final step inside Zbrush I used Decimation Master in order to lower the polycount of each sculpt. I had most pieces sitting at 2-3 million tris. Nanite could handle that but it would result with each mesh being around 200-300 MBs, maybe even more. I found that would be needless given that this high density of poly was not exactly looking more detailed than a well decimated version that would be 100-200k tris (instead of 2-3m). The file sizes of those would be much more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember that we need to UV map these too. UV Mapping a 3m triangles sculpt would be much more taxing on Blender (and on us) than a 300k tris one, which would be a trivial task to uv map if one has a polished, good geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;door-asset&#34;&gt;Door Asset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above described process I used for the creation of the front door as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos029.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Initial blockout of some of the shapes of the door. Screenshot from Blender. Shows a square plate wall. It has a circle cut in the middle. There, a carving shape sits. It has appearance like the Zerg logo from Starcraft.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;85&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;206px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a quick shape exploration in Blender before moving anything into Zbrush. I played with an array modifier with rotations in order to try and get some interesting shape. Here I once again thought at light as my main asset, as such I wanted to create some silhouette that once lit would aggressively cast some interesting shadows in the middle of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos030.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another Blender screenshot. Looks at the door pieces bit further away from. The wall plate and circle cut are now more defined. The shape in the middle is more of a spiral instead of the previous inverted Zerg shape.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;91&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;220px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls to the left and the right were shapes just for placeholder as I knew I would use the existing modular walls in the project instead of making brand new ones unique to the corridor of this door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos031.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;367px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was slight difference in the process of making this door, when compared to the walls we looked at before. In here, I UV mapped my initial pieces and then in Zbrush used non-destructive approach both to the sculpting and the decimation of the topology by the end. That way I preserved my UV maps and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to re-map once the sculpts were ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same approach I used for the circular platform in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos032.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Zbrush screenshot showing the door. The sculpt here is now rich in detail and relief carvings on the surface. Image to the left shows the door at a slight angle, while the image on the right shows it from the very front, in orthographic view.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;361px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a detailed look at my sculpt pass on the door. I&amp;rsquo;ve not included the spiral shape as I thought its not necessary to run a sculpting pass on it - instead it could be ordinary Nanite mesh with just a tiling material on top.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;165&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;396px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the sculpt was done I decimated the asset while preserving UVs. I went into Substance Painter where I baked my maps and set off to texture. In the image above the UVs differ slightly compared to the Blender shots before. That&amp;rsquo;s mainly because I did some extra polish before taking it outside of Blender and into Zbrush. With that I utilized my UV space better to not have the empty space seen in the first Blender UV screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;god-rays-alpha-cards&#34;&gt;God Rays Alpha Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ceiling and the dome appearance was created I put in some god rays and atmospheric 2D alpha cards. Those face the camera at most of the times and if you wanted similar ones you could dig out materials and blueprints set ups from Epic over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/blueprints&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Blueprints - Legacy UE4 Sample Project&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is UE4 and its marked as Legacy in some spots, but the Blueprint set up (and materials) found in there for &amp;ldquo;God Rays&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Fog Cards&amp;rdquo; are set up incredibly well. Their design and function stands perfect even when migrated in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos035.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Unreal Marketplace screenshot. Shows the &amp;ldquo;Blueprints&amp;rdquo; sample project. The screenshot from the project seen above has a butterfly in the middle. If inspected closely, one can notice a long, bright god ray alpha card behind it. That is the ones we are after.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;220&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;529px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roots&#34;&gt;Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the alpha card rays implemented and my attention came back entirely on the lower parts of the scene. Where all of the &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; would take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at it and could see that it was sitting predominantly empty. No detail props or set dressings. Even the walls met the floors at a perfect 90 degrees angle which took away from the natural look of the space and made for an artificial CG look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to remedy that. As such I looked into making bundles of props I could scatter around and about. Pottery, ground dirt pile, smashed pieces of pots. Stone tablets with inscriptions or symbols on them. Fallen parts of the upper ceiling pillars, now sitting on the dusty floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet my walls remained empty. Overly simple. The upper parts of the environment had cracks and tons of damages on the walls, spilling in even further light and using that as a detailing asset. But the lower ones? They were mostly intact. Empty. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to dig out any holes there because the camera would be seeing straight out of them. That would break immersion, because, as you could guess, the exterior scene is completely empty. As such that idea was a no go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is when I started thinking about roots. What if oversized, magical, incredibly wide roots were spiraling around like snakes? They could populate the walls better and reach towards the middle of the room, towards the floating orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pitched that idea out loud to my friend Sophie Deschamps. She loved the idea so much, and being the cool artist she is, without me even asking, took the screenshot I had just sent her and painted over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got me this artwork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos036.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The environment captured from one of the usual camera angles seen before. On top is a concept paint over by hand. It consists of immense, magnificent roots crawling out of the window gaps and reaching towards the orb in the middle. Once a root reaches the middle, its width becomes smaller and it changes color into bright greens and blues. In the middle part the roots start to wiggle upwards, as if trying to reach and touch the orb in the middle of the scene. The orb is colored in an overpowering blue aura.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;173&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;417px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this concept paint over, I knew immediately. I knew that indeed this is the next move and as such I set of to making some roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not describe how helpful and inspiring this paint over was, as such, thank you, Sophie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blueprints-for-the-roots&#34;&gt;Blueprints for the Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My process behind making the roots was at first in big chunk in UE5 itself. The space is already blocked out and I wanted to have a direct and immediate way to &amp;ldquo;crawl&amp;rdquo; around different roots and see their influence and shape on the environment. As such I used a spline system Blueprint directly in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have opened Blender and positioned my floor and walls in the configuration I have in the scene. That would be a trivial and not very time consuming task as I already have all of my measurements set. Its just a matter of moving them from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I dislike jumping in and out of Unreal. I like doing as much as I could in the engine itself as that then keeps my art process with less friction. Frictionless means more creativity and energy spend towards whatever I am creating and not the dialogue that I have between the different software packages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing a tutorial titled &amp;ldquo;UE4 Tutorial: Add spline-meshes procedurally&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the YouTuber but this video, even though old, is very useful.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Video above is UE4 but things seen in it should work well in UE5 too. If some parts are hard to follow, I suggest giving a go to this one instead - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKIiWa19EMI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial - Splines - Spline Meshes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I remember using that at one point or another as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to move between modelling packages, as mentioned already, I imported in UE5 a Blueprint system I had made years prior. It&amp;rsquo;s one that I had started for some random UE4 project I could not even remember now &lt;em&gt;(tutorials for making similar blueprint are seen in the videos above)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I had carried it into my Orbital Gateway, (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;) where I had used it to scatter in line all of the metal platforms. It was also used to shape all of the big, vacuum like cables that are the kernel of the vision of that project. In that Gateway environment I had implemented some improvements into my initial spline Blueprint too. Things like being able to per instance basis pick different static mesh and different material to go onto the spline. It was a solution battle tested and as such I wanted to reuse it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos037.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot of the very first moment I dragged around the tube splines blueprint. I started with very thin and subtle ones. In the middle is the orb floating in the room. To the left of it is a tube that looks like cable. It starts from the upper part of the picture and crawls down the walls and reaches the middle, where the orb is.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in Blender and I made an initial tube that I kept higher in poly than I usually do (as in with extra edge loops). Using Unreal 5 now, unlike back in my previous projects that were Unreal 4, here I could afford higher polycount with the knowledge that all of my blocked out pieces will end up being Nanite meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tube I put into the spline Blueprint. Over the course of a few days I slowly build up bundles of large roots. Those were blockout so if any when taking a turn in the world were looked lowpoly, or any surface got distorted, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I wanted to block them out directly in UE5 but I still had in mind exporting the resulted meshes back into Blender in order to polish the visual slightly and UV map them by the end.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Same angle as before - the orb floats in the middle. Now both to the left, where there were thin cables, but also in the middle of the picture and close to the camera, are tubes that are much more thick and actually look like roots. They branch out in smaller and smaller slithering shapes. Image taken in Unreal 5.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to mention that I&amp;rsquo;ve not implemented control over the thickness of my splines on per spline point basis. As such I could not select a middle point of a root and scale it up to give it thickness. Instead I exported my uniformly thick roots from Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step to do that was to Merge Actors by selecting the spline - opening &amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo; from the Tools submenu - hitting &amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(you can see that in the image below)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would ask me a location to save the spline as a static mesh under the Project Directory. I then navigate to it in the Content Browser, right click on its icon and go to - Asset Actions - Export. That allows me to save the resulting mesh outside of UE5 as an *.fbx. I open that in Blender and I do my thickness scale up polish, UV polish, and subdivision to make it even smoother Nanite mesh. I import that back into UE5 and I replace the original spline blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 editor screenshot, showing an action in 3 steps. First open Tools submenu and select Merge Actors. Second select your spline blueprint in the world (see in the middle of the image). Third, use the newly opened Merge Actors window to save out the splines into ordinary Static Mesh. I suggest doing this by the end of your projects even on splines you like the visual of, as keeping it to splines increases draw calls immensely and will drag performance down. Saving out to Static Mesh bakes it down to one draw call.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paint over from Sophie the roots were incredibly large and impressive. I slowly build up mine to be large too. But I knew I will probably keep them smaller than her concept. I took that decision with the idea of keeping the focal point to be the orb. I thought that if I introduced roots that were very, very thick, they would draw viewers attention. Also I though that if indeed they were that big, I would need to figure out some set dressings and props to put on their surface, as to not leave them too bare, empty, boring and lacking detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;filling-up-the-empty-parts&#34;&gt;Filling up the Empty Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those roots looked at, we could take one step back and see the build up of set dressings in one corner of the environment. That way you could get a better perception of how all of the described details and props added up to build up the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos040.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image above shows a dirty looking Zbrush sculpt I made. It looks not that amazing in the Zbrush render, but once placed in the world with a tiling ground dirt material, to match the floors already there, it helped hide the 90 degrees I mentioned some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The close up from UE5 seen above. This time the pillars protruding from the bent walls are redone and have more square look. They also have intricate rune relieves on them. They are still flatly textured with placeholder materials.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then polished and revamped the pillars (image above). I wanted to give them better shape and texture. Something more realistic and intricate than the first draft. I also added pottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos042.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Shot identical to above. The at first empty spaces are now filled with roots that slither in all directions. The roots now have textures of barks too. There are flower foliage assets that have blue blooms and light up the scene in a magical, eerie glow.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can see the influence of the roots. I textured them using tiling materials from Megascans that I mixed in my own way using triplanar mapping in my UE5 shader. There is also a slight jump with me introducing some foliage and flower pods, but we will go into describing that process in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sophie Deschamps, who did the paint over seen in this entry, is a Level Artist at Ubisoft Montpellier. You can find and follow her work over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SophieDesArt&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we saw the scene fill up with props, dressings and more detail. We looked at using Blueprints spline systems for blocking out roots directly in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, however more going on during, and immediately after everything seen above. It was experiment and struggle with color that persisted for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted different color combinations where the roots flower blooms would light up the scene in blues, purples, reds, oranges. The orb would carry on that color in its fresnel too. Experimenting and switching between those colors went on for a while and then I got some ideas and help from another friend, just the way Sophie helped and inspired me with the roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we will look at that and how that influenced changing the orb in the middle for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos008-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-and-old-concepts&#34;&gt;Novel and Old Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second entry of this series I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to explore my references and early inspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at lots of artists, games, and photographs from all kinds of places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start a new art idea its good to look at plenty of references. You can source your idea or inspiration by mixing together existing paintings, photos, short stories, books and more. It&amp;rsquo;s also integral to look at real life photos. We aim for believable and realistic spaces and layouts (or at least I do in this project). That is even when our subjects are fantastical. As such parts of what we are about to create needs to be grounded on reality. Those parts need to have roots in what is already familiar in the viewers eyes. Then on top you sprinkle bit of the eerie, unknown, novel and bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-stage&#34;&gt;Current Stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the previous blog (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 01 - Beginning&lt;/a&gt;) after figuring out my Houdini orb and that it will be the center piece of the composition and the layout, I was at this stage of the scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos007.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3162&#34;
	height=&#34;1779&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot from the previous blog entry. A circular room with placeholder gray materials and strong orange glow. There is a fuzzy, liquid metal orb in the very middle. Around are pillars with ornate details on their tops. The walls have slight gaps for sci-fi-esque windows. There is a door that is slightly ajar and sunlight comes out of it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some further tweaks and added a little bridge platforms to connect the middle, circular platform to the outer edges of the room. In the very dead center, I cut a gap in order to place more &amp;ldquo;liquid metal&amp;rdquo; type of effect. I wanted to lead to the idea that perhaps in that basin in the middle of the room, there was an inactive substance. Few people, aliens, or some other creatures, enter the room and interact with that inactive substance. With their presence, it comes to life. It forms into the orb that then starts to float in the upper, middle point, space of the large room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you perhaps remember from the last entry, I really wanted to lead towards the idea of a ritual happening in this space. The creatures that enter the room bring the orb to life. They perhaps worship it, fear it, but are also astonished by it. Does it bring them energy? Food? Pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the relationship between these characters and this &amp;ldquo;inanimate&amp;rdquo; object that the next moment seems to come to life and be lively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start new scenes, or any other type of art, I usually make up a few sentences that form a story. The moment I have that I start to ask questions. Those questions are very much like the ones above. They help me refine and see more than what there is at first in my mind. They help me make a 3D space that is more believable, interesting and rich in story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is an exercise I think you should try yourself. Whenever you create a layout, ask yourself why its the way it is? When you place props, ask yourself why they are there and what their relation to other objects around them is? Ask how you can tie up one item to another so they look more coherent?&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 5 screenshot. Camera angle is the same as the image above. This time the strong orange glow in the left parts of the circular room is removed. The gray, placeholder materials have a cooler tone in general as well. The liquid metal orb from Houdini still floats in the middle of the room, but the central platform is now connected by little bridges. There is a basin cut in the middle too, with darkness inside it.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into more screenshots inside this 3D space, lets take a step back. As mentioned in the start of this entry, I want to include my references and early influences behind the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pureref.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PureRef&lt;/a&gt; to put all of my reference images in one place. I like using this piece of software because it&amp;rsquo;s very lightweight. Some people use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://miro.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; which has a similar idea but more annotation tools, sticky notes and other cool features. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that PureRef is easier on the RAM than having a webpage open or using the Miro desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my ref board I make sure to mix plenty of 2D art, 3D art but also real life photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos009.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;973&#34;
	height=&#34;744&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot overlooking my entire PureRef board. Lots of game screenshots, IRL photographs, concepts 2D artworks, 3D art and more is seen as tiny thumbnails.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;130&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;313px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ref boards, this one above I would rate as a relatively tiny. In most of my previous projects I&amp;rsquo;ve went through many more bundles of subjects and pictures and usually my boards expand much more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the creation of this scene I&amp;rsquo;ve been more controlled on the scope of the pieces I want to capture and create. As such that is also reflected in my ref board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to mention is that in the board above in some spots there are screenshots from the project itself. I like to screen cap where I am and put it right next to the reference in order to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-goals&#34;&gt;Initial Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets zoom in on some parts of the board above and see things further in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you about the artists that inspired me and credit them properly in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t personally know any of them but their work is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into this current ritual project I had spent a long while in another block out I was creating in Unreal Engine 5. It was the test scene where I transitioned from UE4 to UE5 and learned the intricacies of UE5s Nanite and Lumen. That project itself was in an &amp;ldquo;Early Preview&amp;rdquo; build of UE5 and had lots of issues and crashes. I never uploaded any screenshots from it, but at some point I might revisit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got my hands on Early UE5, official demos such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/a-first-look-at-unreal-engine-5&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Lumen in the Land of Nanite&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, then later &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/unreal-engine-5-early-access-available-now&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Valley of the Ancient&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/introducing-the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;City Sample (The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal ENgine 5 Experience)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; released. After reading official docs about Nanite and seeing the sculpts and works in those demos I put a goal for my project. That was to try and create sculpts that are as dense and details as some of the assets seen in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I came across the artworks in the image above. The left image, for example, is a sculpt by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/kDyQ0A&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Musaab Shukri&lt;/a&gt; done exactly for the UE5 demo &amp;ldquo;Valley of the Ancient&amp;rdquo;. Work for Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images to the right are concepts by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/VgbLzN&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zak Foreman&lt;/a&gt;. Those are again for the same demos. It depicts the visual fidelity and detail richness that Nanite could pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having realized these will be my visual fidelity goals, I set forward to find some real life photographs again. Some real spaces to get inspired from even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-diwan-i-khas-india&#34;&gt;The Diwan-i-Khas (India)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort), or Hall of Private Audiences is a location in India that I found lots of inspiration in. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see the resemblance in the intricate carvings here when compared to the previous UE5 demos artworks we saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos011.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Reference board screenshot consisting of photographs from Hall of Private Audience, Fatehpur Sikri, Uttar Pradesh, India. Images depict red stoneworks carvings that loop into intricate patterns and snake like elements. There is also a photo from - &amp;ldquo;Interior of Hodha Bai&amp;rsquo;s Palace, Fatehpur Sikri&amp;rdquo;.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;158&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;380px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very early blockouts I had, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really plan to head towards red stone look like the above. I still thought that the carvings are amazing reference for the sculpts I had yet to create. Also for any texture work that would go on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;circular-rooms&#34;&gt;Circular Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also pinned on my board some old, random photos of different circular rooms. I wanted a radial room after all, so I knew I should look at some from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos012.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Six photos put next to one another. The seventh is a game screenshot from &amp;ldquo;Shadow of the Colossus&amp;rdquo;. The others feature baroque and other architectural styles of circular rooms. Most have an opening in the ceiling that hosts set of windows that leak light in. Another photo is of a cave with god rays coming from open ceiling.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;144&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;346px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at different spaces that have above light leaking in and creating nice god rays. When showing my very early blockouts to some friends, they all mentioned &amp;ldquo;Shadow of the Colossus&amp;rdquo; as a game that has very impressive interior shots with lighting just like that one. I&amp;rsquo;ve not played the game myself yet, but I knew I had to put those nice screenshots from it on my moodboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;star-wars-jedi-fallen-order&#34;&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m creating a project I always have immediate influence from the games I am playing at the time. In this case I was playing through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order when creating parts of this environment. These screenshots from the game came into the board relatively late. Yet they (and the game) had a big influence on some of the decision making I took. It also helped me solve some visual issues I had and introduce more details like crack decals on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos013.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;131&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;316px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly looked at this section of the images, seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos014.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Lime-like green but in lots of parts cold gray cave walls. Old, sci-fi star wars structures with golden trims. Stalagmites that climb up in a fantastical, mushrooms-like way.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;159&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;383px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the decal work and base texturing here and found lots of inspiration. Later on I needed more props to populated my empty spaces with, and after being inspired by Jedi I created ground dirt scatter piece as well as a set of pots - some intact, some smashed into pieces. I will showcase these later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collaborators&#34;&gt;Collaborators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later through the project I had the pleasure to be inspired and helped by few more artists. Those are some of my friends and their influence here was direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hayleyrumbold.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hayley Rumbold&lt;/a&gt; joined me in the creation of this project as a collaborator and a Cinematic Artist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Phil Cockburn&lt;/a&gt; left me lots and lots of tips and feedback through it all too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to mention them now though I will show you the works they created and the amazing influence they had in more detail inside the next blog entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-assets&#34;&gt;Initial Assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having seen most of the reference images, we could step back now and see some of the first blockout shapes I made in Blender.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;139&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos016.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1168&#34;
	height=&#34;935&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image of the same pieces seen above but now at an angle, in perspective, instead of a frontal, orthographic view like before.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;124&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;299px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the pieces I initially made and blocked out the scene. Some artists use Zbrush to block out pieces like that. I prefer to make these using a subdivision workflow, directly in Blender. I start by extruding a cube around and then beveling it in such a way that when I apply a Catmull-Clark subdivision on top, I get smooth, but not overly smooth shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make an absolute mess of the geometry. In some cases I insert lots of ngons (not seen in many obvious places here, but I still do). When using Catmull-Clark I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about my geometry flow mainly because I know the algorithm will make all of it into quads by the end when applied. If those quads follow awful edge loops, I frankly don&amp;rsquo;t mind. I don&amp;rsquo;t because I know that what I am making is then directly going into Zbrush. Once in there I will Dynamesh to get my to a density of geometry I like. When I do that any bad edge loops and flows gets retopologized to something much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos019.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Wireframe view of one of the pieces seen above. Zoomed in, the image shows the edge loops and topology.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;125&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;301px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a resulting topology (image above). One that actually is pretty clean compared to some of the descriptions I wrote above, that happen most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the walls I later duplicated a few times in Blender:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To then as described above take into Zbrush:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos018.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;132&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;318px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I refined my geometry, made topology that can hold good brush stokes and then detailed on top to get me to more finalized assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this all is an exercise in Nanite, I was not scared to be dense in topology and detail. I tried to make silhouettes rich in detail where the cracks and damages are. In some of the other wall pieces, I stamped stencil details in the form of writings, symbols and ritualistic stone carvings. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to rely on baking those down onto a lower poly, but instead use Decimation Master in Zbrush to get me to a lower dense poly, suitable for Nanite (as in being 150-200k tris. Even though Nanite could totally handle keeping some of the sculpts at 2-3m tris, it proved to be pointless and not add much detail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;platform-sculpts&#34;&gt;Platform Sculpts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos020.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Three props seen in a Blender screenshot. First one is a large, circular platform. Second is a pie cut modular piece. Third one is a bent wall.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;431px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My platform in the very center of the middle, I kept as one big shape. That is the first prop seen in the Blender screenshots above. Keeping it one big shape might sound a bit insane because it might be incredibly hard to keep high texel density even on 4k textures. That&amp;rsquo;s given how large the entire piece is. As such I briefly considered making a pie cut 1/4 of it, to then rotate by copying 3 more times and getting me the entire circle. I decided against that mainly for one reason: I knew I will create a dense Nanite mesh. As such I knew that most of my detail will sit in the geometry itself. If on top a slightly lower density albedo texture went, I decided it would not be a problem. Sculpting details on a platform this large on top, would also be quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the outer ring platform that wraps around that same platform, I decided to use the &amp;ldquo;pie cut&amp;rdquo; approach. I did that mainly because with its radius going further out the main platform, its cover area increased. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t scared of the texel density (though at that point I should have been) but more of the chore that sculpting such a giant piece would turn into, if I were to keep the entire ring a unique prop, instead of a pie cut. As such I made it into a &amp;ldquo;modular&amp;rdquo; cut and duplicated it many times in the scene, rotating it about, building up the rooms floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos021.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Zbrush red matcap screenshot showing the circular platform now sculpted on top. It has brick-like details but also lots of swirling circle motives that give it a sci-fi, alien look.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;225&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;542px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image was the first sculpt I did on the platform right after I took it into Zbrush. Going back to that talk about &amp;ldquo;familiar vs novel&amp;rdquo; right at the start of this blog, with this sculpt I later started to worry that the swirling, circular motives looked too alien. They are nice in an &amp;ldquo;alien crop circles&amp;rdquo; kind of way. But are they perhaps too abstract for this scene? Making everything look too smooth, too fudged and &lt;em&gt;non-concrete&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos022.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Substance Painter screenshot. Shows the same platform as above, but now the sculpt is different and has more &amp;ldquo;brick&amp;rdquo; appearance. To the right is the UV view. All of the brick details are actual geometry as this is a Nanite mesh and I wanted to keep it more dense.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;178&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;429px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I went back and sculpted it once more. This time around keeping a certain array of circles towards the middle, but in the outer parts giving a more structured, brick appearance. Seen in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scene-shots&#34;&gt;Scene Shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the platform in the context of the scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos023.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3162&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot showing the middle platform. It has a cut in the middle that has a basin full of darkness and starry-looking texture. Little, untextured bridges at the sides lead to the outer platform radius.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the old version. Below is the new one. I also put in some scene lights recolors and texture recolors to give everything a more controlled and realistic appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos024.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 5 screenshot. Camera angle is the same as above but now the platform sculpt is more refined. The little bridges are textured. The lighting in the scene is less orange and red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoomed in towards the middle, we can inspect the platform and the &amp;ldquo;darkness basin&amp;rdquo; in the middle too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos025.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1007&#34;
	height=&#34;1050&#34;

		alt=&#34;The middle platform and the basic cut in the middle, seen through a zoomed in camera.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;95&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;230px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the gaps of the bricks I put in flat planes. On those I added a liquid metal texture. At some point I was imagining the idea of cutting little canals going from the middle basin towards the outsides of the platform. In those canals liquid full of white stars would flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought its an interesting idea but I later abandoned it as I was worried that after introducing some other details on the outskirts of the scene, having black and white, high contrast, liquid in the cracks of the platforms proved to introduce visual clutter. It was making the scene fall a part more than it was tying it together or the novelty of the idea was worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next blog post we will look at the upper parts of the scene. We will inspect all of the wall and dome pieces seen in the Blender screenshots above which I used to create the higher parts of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also revamped the pillars, just the way I reworked the middle platform above. I gave them more structure, carved runes and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed seeing all of this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 05 - Portal Aperture</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/orbital005.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 05 - Portal Aperture" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aperture&#34;&gt;Aperture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys. Here is some progress on the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been making the past days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/orbital005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle from Unreal 4. Compared to the last blog post, now the greeble panels are much more populated with little details. The portal has a sharp fang-like aperture around it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual I spent even more time on the greebles and putting more detail on them. I made one or two new greeble panels and I am up to nearly 9 of them in total now. Two of which still have a few empty corners. I also struggled to reuse them in one or two places specifically, where no matter which one I put it became obvious there is repetition. So I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just make a final extra one before calling their number be set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sculpt&#34;&gt;Sculpt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some experiments with some details around the portal entrance itself too. I made an aperture-like piece that has sharp, fangs-like appearance. But before that I also made a sculpt of a face. It&amp;rsquo;s eyes are covered by cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-2021-01-20_232220-02.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1346&#34;
	height=&#34;616&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Maya screenshot to the left, showing the aperture cables and details. Zbrush screenshot to the right showcasing a human head sculpt that is then used as a sci-fi, H.R Giger-like detail.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;218&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;524px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sculpted it in Zbrush. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that much detail but arguably it&amp;rsquo;s not really needed for it to have any as it&amp;rsquo;s just a detail piece mounted above and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really need to be a centrepiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress gif:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-004.gif&#34;
	width=&#34;974&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Timelapse gif showing the further build up of greebles.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fang bits have placehold gold material although I think I might keep a type of gold by the end too. On some of the greebles and most of the portal I will try some light and silver metals and as such I really want to try to contrast some gold pieces and details here and there too. For a renaissance or art deco in outer space kind of a style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00093-02.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The portal structure captured from a more lower angle camera, looking up. In the middle is a platform with yellow glow and humans. Shows the scale of the place.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start the materials and textures I&amp;rsquo;ll also tint everything towards more blue most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always forget to mention this, but I am thinking of later on having a go at some VFX and interesting visuals for the portal plane itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it completely white as it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Neon Graveyard - 07 - Neon Signs</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/cover007.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Neon Graveyard - 07 - Neon Signs" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-006/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;casket&lt;/a&gt; prop, I&amp;rsquo;ve had time to go back to the overall scene and continue working on missing props and details for the landscape. The other thing is refining textures and figuring out how exactly I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle making the neon signs. Previously, my neons were just simple alpha cards with an emissive text. Although in its core that&amp;rsquo;s what neon signs look like anyway, I wanted to put more attention and detail into them than just that. Possibly build a more complex material shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the last two posts were about the casket, it&amp;rsquo;s been a very long while since we&amp;rsquo;ve last seen the scene as a whole. As such I am just going to show you at what stage I am right now, and then we can talk about how I created the different bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as a reminder - this was we had before (three weeks ago or so):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to make some even more dynamic, by having letters flick. The metal mounts of each sign still lack textures, but that will be for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text that&amp;rsquo;s lit up is in Russian and reads the same way as the English one next to it &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Backup your Consciousness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a play on words as well, which I will animate for the final video. The idea I have in mind with that is about the text in Russian, appearing lit up fully at first - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Сохраняйте свое сознание&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The whole sign then flicks on and off a few times, as if short on electricity. When it powers up again, its left with just &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;охраняй сознание&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. First and last two letters from the first word are off, second word is entirely off. And what we are left with reads from &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Backup your&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Guard your Consciousness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I made the alpha cards of the neons into 3D objects. I made a few of the texts into actual geometry, but then when I inserted them in, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell from afar that they are dimensional and 3D. Going up close to them, most still looked relatively the same - flat. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided that there is no really point into turning them into expensive on memory 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain text with an emissive material was flat as well, and as such I went into trying to figure out another way to make them look better, more dimensional, and more neon-ish. That&amp;rsquo;s when I though of trying a transparent text with a border. I then put a second border to that said border. The inner border, I assigned bright color together with emission. The outer border, I left dark. The fact that they are transparent from the inside, boosted the illusion of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;neon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. What I discovered then, is a trick I made up which turned them actually dimensional &lt;em&gt;(sadly probably not very well seen in the GIFs due the small image size)&lt;/em&gt;. I duplicated the text as it is in the world in the engine. I then offset its position by a few pixels backwards from the original position. To that second copy, I then applied an instance of the original material. In that instance, I can change the previously exposed parameters such as the colors of the inner and outer borders, as well as emission level of the glow. Then, by changing those colors, to ones completely different from the original, I managed to create an illusion of depth. The result is best seen when you move the camera while looking at the signs from a side. The secondary colors, from the text copy that is behind, leak and bloom softly. They contrast so well with the front text, that whilst you move, they make the whole text appear as if an actual neon, with dimension and shifts in the value and hue of its color. That effect is apparent even from the static shot seen above, that showcases the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; neon.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The borders, I created in Photoshop using Blending Options - Stroke. To keep everything optimised, I suggest making those masks into a single image. In the image above, I&amp;rsquo;ve put the two different borders, onto two channels - one on Green, the other on Blue. In the material shader, I simply take those channels and assign them color and emission value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve showed you how I do this with a single text - &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; taking a whole bitmap of 512x512, but for this project, I actually keep every text and neon design, into one single image. In a 2k texture, you can fit much more than you would think, and using every channel - R, G and B - allows for even more effects and optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zbrush, I imported low-poly models of headstones that I created in Maya. I turn them high-poly by dividing the geometry with smooth off. I then sculpt detail on that and when I am happy with the result, I create a new, low-poly version, by decimating the topology. For that, I use Decimation Master, that can be found in Zbrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov14.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headstone seen below, I decimated from 2.3m tris to 2k using Decimation Master. When you go to poly that low, you can freely take the model in Maya, and UV map it by hand. 2k tris is not too much, and as such the automatic mapping in the newer versions of Maya does quite a good job. It takes most of the flat surfaces and gives you whole UV islands, and it leaves just a few weird triangles here and there, that you can quickly sew back in place. Small edges with lots of damage on them, usually get mapped weirdly too, but you can go over those and fix them with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;409px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of giving the weird letters on the headstones, actual metal mounts and have some cables run towards them from the ground. Right now they sort of give the vibe of magical runes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-things&#34;&gt;Other Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the landscape I&amp;rsquo;ve scattered some detail using small rocks, broken pavement as well as some cables. I&amp;rsquo;ve created the cables as a spline system, and although it took a bit of time to place as many copies as I&amp;rsquo;ve done, it was very fun to do. Obviously, I tried having them glowing at first, but decided against it as it was getting a bit too much in the way. Their texture might still need some more work though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cathedral in the distance will still need some more attention. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of some decals and props to scatter and give variety and detail both to the roof and to the walls. The windows will have stained glass material to them, with an emissive mask. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to achieve some electrical whimsical colors, to fit the Cyberpunk vibe. I&amp;rsquo;ve left them for this late on, as I already have plans on how to create them in Substance Designer. Working on materials like that is probably one of the things I enjoy most in 3D, and frankly said, that&amp;rsquo;s why I am keeping them as a treat to myself after I get the rest of the important things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you found this post insightful and interesting. Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last post we mentioned the most important Blueprints we need in order to have actual gameplay. They do build the win/lose condition, but we still need one more very important element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need what I call right now, and am going to refer to, with the word “blocks”. The blocks are the pieces that go on the environment to cast shadows here and there. The blocks are what the player is in control of, as I said way back in the first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tetris-pieces&#34;&gt;Tetris Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game, I have tiles, that put together create the map/surface area. Then, on top of those, go the blocks. They fit together perfectly in slots, as I need it to be visually explicit where a player is allowed to place and where they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First “sketch” of the shapes I did in Maya. It was a quick test to see what shape could work the best. At that point in my mind I already knew I wanted one shape repeated many times like a tile, but I still was not certain what that shape would be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;342px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I did anything, I had a quick sketch, that does not look very impressive, that I made in Photoshop. It was more of a guide for the mood, that was assuring me I am going in the direction I want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could probably see that the image I produced above, was what inspired me to go towards a blue starry sky, overall dark tone, and a very bright sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also sort of see the path, illustrated in blue, and the idea of going from point A to point B as a main objective in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sun&#34;&gt;Sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had figured out the visual of the tiles, and the Sun next to them, the first draft was a hollow, holographic looking star. Although I said I don’t have plenty of time to create textures and shaders (thus the tiles are textureless) I still needed to make sure the Sun has a texture. The Sun needs one, because it is a main game mechanic element. We need to be able to tell, visually, that it’s big, that it’s hot, and that it is potentially dangerous. It can’t simply be hollow. That is when I went into making a texture and some basic animation for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final visuals of the sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun is created from two spheres that go inside each one. The outer one is a low poly, with a Fresnel Shader applied to it. It gives it the triangular holographic look, that flickers with a subtle animation. Inside of it is a proper texture, unlit Shader, that has an animated normal and some glow too. Both materials can be controlled for a change in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_026.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different colors of the stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some levels of the game could have multiple suns different locations. In that case I can have selection of colors so each is unique, more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-block-pieces&#34;&gt;Back to the Block Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What those needed was a “placement system” Blueprint. It was good that I knew exactly how I wanted that. That’s, again, thanks to the traditional RTS games. What I ended up making is simple in words, but more complex in Blueprints. It’s a system where you can click on a block to place it, it becomes semi-transparent and red (again with the help of a Fresnel function). If you point to a tile, that is marked with a Boolean that says “True” for “Is this tile Place-able on?”, then the transparent color turns green. It also lets you place it on top if you click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system for that is quite complex and I genuinely would have to do a few posts to find a way to explain it like a tutorial. Something, for which sadly there is no time right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also have to thank my brother, Miroslav Dimitrov, who is a programmer and helped me figure out the logic of a few things I needed to do, so I could properly turn them into Blueprints. I am sure he did not find it as amusing and fun as I did, mainly because he writes in code, has no idea how Blueprints work, and had to just guide me and watch me struggle on my own with Unreal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guide for anyone that might want to make a system like that is to look into &lt;strong&gt;Get Hit Result Under Cursor by Channel&lt;/strong&gt;. That is basically a line trace that goes where the location of the mouse cursor is. After you use that, do a check to what object the mouse is pointing at, and then have your IFs to change color, check if placement is possible and et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_027.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the game showing the tiles and a sun next to them. The mouse cursor is hovered over a specific tile that has a triangular gap inside. With the mouse being there, a holographic, green, obstacle tile shows on top. It&amp;rsquo;s an indication that the tile is a valid placement. (like in an RTS)&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;180&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;432px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pointing the mouse at valid slot tiles makes the block green. Red for not being able to place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blocks-visuals&#34;&gt;Blocks Visuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to mention, that given the blocks are so important and the player interacts with them, it would make sense to have textures and proper interesting models for them. I would love to do that, but for now just a different color will have to do. I will go back to it and maybe model out something, given that after I completed all of the important Blueprints I need, and I make a few playable levels, I am left with some free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research on how the blocks could potentially look just randomly walked through my door one day. Or more like not my door, but the door of the university building I am in during classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful statues, courtesy of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cherylvollorceramics/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those intricate ceramic statues, painted with acrylic on top (if I remember correctly) are created by &lt;em&gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/em&gt;. I met her randomly in the first showcase room here at UCLAN in Preston. To get to the studio of our class, you walk through an entrance, small “hall” of sorts, where every week different art displays are put on. That’s where Cheryl had the exhibit of her statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I first saw them, I suddenly imagined some of the maps of my game to be like that. A weird, alien environment, with peculiar crystal formations and colorful blocks that are in a juxtaposition with the dull monotone colors of the surface. The player could pick up those blocks and move them around. This whole thought came to me way before I had done any prototyping and it just sparkled a lot of excitement in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Cheryl, who was amazing, and let me use the visuals of her statues in any game I created or for any research I would need. Thanks again for that, Cheryl!&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another picture of ceramic sculptures. This time around not only is the ground in whites and blues/purples but the protruding parallelepipeds also have those colors. They are also angled in an uneasy fashion, as opposed to the first picture where they were nearly perfectly upright.&#34;

    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I said, we will sadly have to wait to see if I get some free time to “upgrade” the visuals of my blocks with anything remotely similar to those pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you found this visual research intriguing. Next we will look into the first playtest with actual living people, that my game saw! Woah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly update this entry to mention that there was no &amp;ldquo;next time&amp;rdquo;. I wrapped up the project by adding a few extra levels and having it all then playable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will admit to you though, that the game prototype was behind, priority wise, on the list of my other works, given I had at the time focused on crafting an Environment Art portfolio to try and find my break into the industry later that same 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such I put most of my attention in &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo; (both of which you can read in detail about by using the &amp;ldquo;Category&amp;rdquo; buttons to the right whilst on the main page of this blog).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did, however, create a &amp;ldquo;trailer&amp;rdquo; for the game, as part of the course. I never got to writing another entry to these blogs and showing it there, but here it is for you:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;game-trailer&#34;&gt;Game Trailer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgjCF3PDWnI&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No mention of &amp;ldquo;vampires in space&amp;rdquo;. Kind of a missed opportunity, 2019 Peter! Instead just &amp;ldquo;Astronauts&amp;rdquo;? Oh well&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see in the trailer that I tried to keep it humorous and easy going, as I thought then, and still believe that would be the right course of action for the game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Unreal 4 screenshot of the what is now main camera angle. In the middle are few stone basins for water. Next to them are little animal statues: frogs and rabbits. Behind those are the steps with the stone lantern. Everything now has much more color and behind those elements are mossy stone surfaces.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally blocked out the calligraphers hut properly. It&amp;rsquo;s actually more than just a greybox, as I split the hut properly into finalised modular pieces, UV mapped most of them and even turned the front one that&amp;rsquo;s kind of dramatically lit in the picture, into a high-poly. It&amp;rsquo;s all ready for some arduous hand-sculpting in Zbrush before baking and texturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I made a rabbit sculpture. Today I made two frogs. I have this idea that the shrine could be one for offerings towards animals like rabbits, frogs, turtles, cranes, foxes and so on. All of them are seen in specific ways in Japanese culture, and I could have references to that in the calligraphers hut with the scrolls on the walls. I mean, those are common animals, they have their role in every single culture, but still I thought it could be an interesting and nice way to fill in the empty space of the environment. Also its an opportunity for me to have a go at making my own sculpts and seeing what I can produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a grand idea about all of them tying up together in a specific way, to be seen in my final video fly-through, but we will see if I have the time to do it, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go into explaining it this early.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;302px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I finally sculpted and textured the staircase, the Komainu and the modular fence pieces. I am quite happy with the dog and the stairs, but those wood textures of the fencing could probably do with some more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-011/27_shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The main staircase now has stone textures applied and proper, beveled and damaged edges (as opposed to the previous lowpoly placeholder). On each side, the Foo Dogs (Komainu) now have textures too.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;122&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;294px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the modular pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-011/25_shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;402px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll make some golden ornaments to break up the places in the wood where its too uniform (I mean, look at that corner piece&amp;hellip;), but I am more worried for the wood texture itself. I tried quite a few ones I made in Designer, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like any of them. I will have to try again I presume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progression&#34;&gt;Gif progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted any GIFs in ages, lets have one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-011/06-japan-peter-dimitrov.gif&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Progress gif showing the build up of the scene. Everything gets properly texture, the placeholder replaced for animal statues. The calligraphers hut takes slowly proper shape and its roof gets more and more intricate.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can notice the change in the calligraphers hut here easier. Something else too - I completely changed the source of the light in the scene. It was coming from the left, but I rotated it to go directly from the right (as seen from this camera angle). It put the right-hand side into a dramatic shadow, giving much more dynamic feel to the whole scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about the light-source also makes me think how I will need to work on the skybox at some point. It&amp;rsquo;s not seen much from this angle, but in my other main camera shot, we can see the sky quite a bit more. And then that reminds me that I need actual mountains and trees (or bamboo) in the distance. And all of that reminds me of even more unfinished stuff, but lets stop this rabbit-hole here. Ahhhh! Maybe I should have some rabbit holes too? Would be mysterious, right? Nah, I&amp;rsquo;m just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Have a good night from me.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;411px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t much created anything finished these last days. It has been more a process of exploration and learning of lots of things I had to go through. I started sculpting a Foo Dog, or what they call in Japan, a Komainu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-008/17-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;105&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;252px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of it, in my opinion at least, is that statues like those which are actually old, fall in a weird, soft &amp;ldquo;uncanny valley&amp;rdquo; territory. Sculptors that made them obviously did the best they could for their time. Do you know whose else&amp;rsquo;s work falls in a category like that? Well, mine does. See, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience sculpting. But because I am making something &amp;ldquo;ancient&amp;rdquo;, I can get away with having weird proportions here and there. Although I did try to keep most of it appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor guy is still missing detail on his paws, but I&amp;rsquo;ll spend some time on that before I bake him. His backside also looks a bit like a squirrel, but its an improvement from the look of a incapacitated rabbit that he had at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might leave him looking a bit weird like that, because I can get away with it as of the aforementioned reasons. It might even add that extra charm and mystique to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the lesser of my problems though. I started doing textures for the ground, and sadly I still don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to show although I did quite a bit of work. I did realize a lot of stuff though, and it keeps me positive that when I continue with it in the next days, I should have some successful materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a quick ordinary stone texture. Something to add to my library as I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use any of the Painter defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-008/japan_peter_dimitrov_mat02.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;410px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also exposed all of the values - hue, saturation and value + some parameters for how much and deep the cracks are. Should be quite useful and a lot of models that call for stone materials are waiting for me anyway. I will do a moss now and mix the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another model. A detail, as I badly need those at this point, my scene is quite empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-008/08_haybell_peter_dimitrov.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those big twisty bits and the things underneath them that look like bells right now, are made out of hay. Everything is tied together with ropes and looks quite immense and amazing to be fair. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass on having something like that. Gonna bake it on a lower poly model and do the hay in Substance Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show you the reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a final thought, today I started some foliage. I am doing a bamboo-like plant. I keep calling it bamboo, but it really isn&amp;rsquo;t. Its supposed to have thinner branch and lots of leaves that are more circular and spread out. Doing that in Maya, the leaves in Zbrush and then all baked and textured in Substance Designer (Thanks a lot to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/kazperstan&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think about it guys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for those of you who who made it through this long and boring blog post, and are reading this, I have a question. This foliage left me puzzled, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t really done any before&amp;hellip; Could you tell me how you do yours, guys? How do you put it in the engine and what options look the best? See, at the end, I left the mesh (imported and used as foliage with the foliage brush) to be dynamic. Leaving it to static, and baking lightmaps, at no matter what resolutions, produced a cluster of black rigged edges. No matter the size. Feels like increasing the resolution of the lightmap even makes it worse (does not make any sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene is quite empty yet, I haven&amp;rsquo;t placed many pieces of foliage at all, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been really smart with my lightmaps resolutions so far. Not being able to bake this as static makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot. Any comments are much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
