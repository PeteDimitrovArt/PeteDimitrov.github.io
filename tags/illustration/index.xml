		alt=&#34;A woman dressed in a white shirt and an oversized, metal shoulder pad on her left. The shoulder pads has sci-fi panels and textures. There are also circular elements with teal, sci-fi glow on them. The woman has a headset with a microphone. Her eyes are hologram-like teal color. Behind her is a planet. In all directions, facing away from the planet as a center point, lots of large spaceships fly away. They are on a voyage towards the stars.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a long while since the last time I posted a painting, but here is one I created after playing around with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://recklessdeck.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Reckless Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t ordinary do much Sci-Fi, but I have a hidden love for it, having grown up predominantly watching Sci-fi TV-shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the deck, I had the idea of this character being an AI that has an actual, physical headset, where her chip-sets are. She then projects light downwards through that headset, generating her whole body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did attempt to make her a hologram, but to be fair it did not add anything to the composition visually speaking. Just made it look more cluttered. As such I left her looking like a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More of her story? I will leave that to your fantasy. Maybe she is a hyper intelligent AI, guiding the human race (or her creators species) through the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At what point were the augmentations so manifold, they changed her true nature? After all, thanks to them she was able to connect. A glimpse into so many minds, that every synapse in her brain was firing. A feeling of ecstasy caused by the chemical reactions. It was real. More real than anything she had experienced before. A true connection. But with whom? Or even, with what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece is a special one for me. I put a lot into it and it is not my ordinary scary, monstrous art. And that is why I love it. Took nearly 30 hours which is the piece I have worked the longest so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you do enjoy it as much as I do. Make sure to check out the time-lapse painting (just scroll down and you will see it). Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Making of “Drone of Clouds and Minds” - Time-lapse Painting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEEMr1PVabg&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the video of the making of my last painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I publish my paintings, I always feel the urge to write and explain how and why I went down the path I did with the creation process. Most social medias don’t give you that opportunity though. Also, sadly, most people run around and are so busy these days that I just cant see myself intriguing anyone to sit down and read a piece of writing. No matter if it takes just 5 or 10 minutes, sometimes even less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a following is also hard and I don’t know if this is the place where people are interested in the insights of a struggling artist. But anyways, here it goes (if you like what I say and would like to see it integrated in the video itself next time, do say so please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creation-process&#34;&gt;Creation Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a university drawing assignment calling for the creation of a character. Well no, this here is not the character that I created for university. What I handed in was a half-assed magician with a robe and very broad shoulders. But one of the initial ideas I had with him was: I wanted him to hold a magical fire. And I wanted it to be something interesting, something novel. So I thought, why not follow some mathematical shapes? Maybe he is a wizard that knows every secret of this world? And he resides in a world, where, though predominantly fantastical, science still exists. Who knows, if they had a scientist good enough, they could probably formulate magic itself too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I said - well, his fire will have a three dimensional shape that is a bit more unorthodox. He will be holding a fire that is an polyhedron. Maybe icosahedron? 20 faces. That didn’t matter at the time. I even wanted it more abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/polyhedrons.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;485&#34;
	height=&#34;555&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;87&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;209px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some polyhedrons can be seen above. I especially liked the one numbered 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept stuck with me, but I wanted to explore it in a personal painting, and not something related to university. Here came another idea, one that I had circling in my mind for the prior 4-5 months. A portrait of a woman looking directly into an abstract shape. As such this sketch was born:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/painting_sketch_500_drone.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;500&#34;
	height=&#34;378&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;132&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;317px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see how it started loosing its mathematical concept and went more into an abstraction. The days that followed though, I had doubts whether I want to be exploring something as abstract or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/strong&gt;, the Wizard had some incredible held in off-hand sources and orbs. And although its been very long since I last played, I think that some of the electric colors and interesting shapes had an influence on me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/diablo_wi_400.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;285&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;54&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;130px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the off-hands in Diablo 3. While painting I didn’t use any of this as a reference, but I believe the game had left a mark on my mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me cynical, but a lot of art will circle around and become famous for just being a tiny bit abstract but immensely pretty. There is nothing wrong with it, but I just think people are prone to easily liking stuff that is just pretty and nothing else. Sometimes there even isn’t any deeper meaning into it. I wanted a beautiful painting &lt;em&gt;(for a change in my ordinary monstrous portfolio)&lt;/em&gt;  but I wanted more than that into it. So I started exploring the idea of a robot. Or a drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/drone_sketch_500.png&#34;
	width=&#34;500&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;75&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;180px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first sketches of the drone. It ended up looking totally different, but you can see the starting points and similarities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of that you can see in the video itself. Also, this blog post already stretched to be a bit too lengthy, so I will leave the rest of the insights for the video itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you can see in the title of the article above, I created this painting back in 2017. It still holds a special place in my heart and I think I learned a few things whilst making it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are some parts of it that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer really satisfied with as well. The months after I created this illustration I revisited it and slightly positioned the right eye of the character better on her face, fixing it all up a bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I remember I really struggled with aother thing in this artwork back then. It&amp;rsquo;s her skin. The tone and the texture of it. I remember the issue lingering on the back of my mind way back then when I was painting it. I think I gave my best shot at trying to overcome it. Now looking at it through the lenses of time, I don&amp;rsquo;t really think I managed to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have the interest of painting on top of it once again, 6 years later. I believe it would be more productive, and kind of cooler, if I were to take the character and completely repaint / remake them in the skillset I have now. Into a brand new composition. If I&amp;rsquo;ll ever get into doing that though, I am doubtful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet I wanted to describe what I would do differently, knowing what I know now, with the hopes that perhaps it could be intriguing. Or useful to any 2D artist out there reading this right now and analyzing my artistic process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;asd&amp;hellip;to continue writing&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
