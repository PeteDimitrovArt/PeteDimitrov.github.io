&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about the process of creating the art I share. It all started a bit before I joined university, when I thought I might write a quick explanation behind the process of how I create my illustrations. That was to go along with some speed painting timelapses I had recorded at the time and put up on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At university, when I got into learning 3D, I continued that tradition. End of 2018 I joined my first Artstation challenge. Feudal Japan. In there, people were requested, and encouraged to write blog posts about the creation of their works. Those could be short or long, as long as there were plenty of images to show progress in their entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered then, how to approach my posts. Given I had love for writing prior to that, I thought I might be a bit more wordy in some entries. I through I might share my thought process and why I take the decisions I take in the shaping of the 3D spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed that so much that the following year, once I was making my next scene, one that was not for any challenge, I documented its creation in its own blog entries. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-009/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following all that was the blog entries surrounding the portal, megastructure of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short break followed, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t write as much, as I was moving jobs, from an indie place to where I am working now, as an Environment Artist at Rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I decided to get back into it, though. I had spent the past years on and off building a new personal artwork. I thought this might be another cool opportunity to share insights from my creation process with any reader that might be interested into it. Especially given I had been leaning and experimenting heavily with Nanite, Lumen and all kinds of new features in Unreal Engine 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-blog-website&#34;&gt;New Blog Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I started thinking that I would love to have my own platform for my blogs. My own website, my homestead, so to say. In addition, the many entries from my previous years of writings had been all scattered to the winds. Some of my earliest on Tumblr, few then in their own tab and page for an Artstation challenge, then followed by my Artstation blog section on a completely different URL. Then to go away again on yet another unique page. I had written for some websites as a guest too, and I realized some of those are no longer up online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website of my own would be the perfect opportunity to tie all lose ends and put it all in one place, as it should have always been. That is when I started looking into options and considering what would be the best way to create said website. Oh, what a journey that has been. I am no stranger to web design. My creative journey, some 10-12 years ago, when I was a young, curious kid, started with graphics design and web design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, I enjoyed and did that for quite a long while. My brother Miroslav Dimitrov helped me, doing coding while I would do graphic design. I grew tired of it (which sounds a bit melodramatic for a kid, but it was the truth). As such I started exploring other creative outlets which lead me straight into 2D art and painting. That was with the idea to one day do concepts and illustrations for video games. All of those countless of hours playing Lineage II and World of Warcraft could not go to waste, after all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2D to 3D then to breaking into the games industry in late 2019 first as a 3D Generalist / Tech Artist. Then to move to Rebellion in 2021 as an Environment Artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that? To circle back to web design now, in the creation of my own blog space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating, writing and deploying a website, be it static or more complex is much more pleasant experience now in 2023 than it was back in 2013 when we were fully engaged with that craft, together with my brother. As such I can&amp;rsquo;t say, or take, too much credit for many of the work that goes in here. If you are curious as to how it was created, or want something similar of your own, you can explore the link at the footer of this page. Still I want to put special thanks to Jimmy, who is the original creator of the template I used and revamped to fit my artistic and visual inclinations. I also want to say special thanks to Miroslav, my brother, who helped me figure out and remind myself with the intricacies of web so I could accomplish what I have in this website. I appreciate all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;archives---older-blog-entries&#34;&gt;Archives - Older Blog Entries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this blog going live, forward on I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing new entries about the current projects I have. There is one, I&amp;rsquo;ve code named &amp;ldquo;Shape Ritual&amp;rdquo; where I explore a ruined, circular room with a floating, magical orb in the middle. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to tell you, and show you all about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can find all of my previous years of writings and blog entries here too. They are dated to the original time and ported in here identical as they were originally, in the moments I wrote them first. There are no changes a part from a small grammatical or typo fixes here and there. Some of the platforms I initially used to write parts of them also didn&amp;rsquo;t have easy way for adding alt text on images. As such I&amp;rsquo;ve went back and added image descriptions on some pieces that might have initially missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the entries, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated with new information. Or new thoughts. Or recollections from what I remember I had circling in my mind back then, but left unsaid (or more like unwritten). In those entries, you will see a clear division between what was the original post and what is a newer update. I hope you enjoy those updates as with most of them I&amp;rsquo;ve strived to inform and educate on anything new I&amp;rsquo;ve come to learn since then, improving performance, fixing tech issues or just setting up common good practices for creating 3D art and playable, realtime game scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;suggested-reading&#34;&gt;Suggested Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering where to begin, I&amp;rsquo;ve got some suggestions for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to go into a more chronologically inclined way, you could begin over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-019/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This link will take you to see the final blog post and as such the final result.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would like to dive from entry one from the series instead? Seeing the look at my early exploration and moodboard gathering? You can do so over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine - 01 - Start&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was created with Unreal 4, Maya, Substance Painter and Designer and if you explore the entries of it, you will find behind the scenes screenshots from those softwares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancy starting the one of the more recent ones? You can give a go to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Like above, this link will take you to the end, final showcase of the project, letting you preview the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/sitelaunch/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00032.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Very early UE4 screenshot of &amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway&amp;rdquo; showcasing a megastructure in the middle that later through the works shapes to be a giant portal with tiny greeble and cable details on its surface.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To teleport yourself right into the very beginning, first entry of the series, you can go over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway - 01 - Reference / Concept&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be a fan of punk and horror noir, then I&amp;rsquo;ve got just the thing for you. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-009/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; will scratch your cyberpunk itch in a macabre flooded in neon lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/sitelaunch/HighShot00028.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Early blockout screenshot from the project &amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo;. Created in Unreal Engine 4. Image showcases a small hill with a chapel on it. The chapel has neon signs attached. In front of that are lots of gravestones.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the very first entry, try out this link - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard - 01 - Start&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you find insight and inspiration in some of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-me&#34;&gt;Support Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who like to read and observe my art and for those who might have found insight or knowledge and have the resources to consider it, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a way to support my works. At the bottom of most blog entries you will find a Ko-fi button. It takes right where if you wish you could drop a tip. A coffee, so to say. That support would mean tons to me and would allow me to continue writing and creating the art that you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strive for my insights and educational pieces to be free of charge. Easy to access by anyone and everywhere. As such if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the means to, don&amp;rsquo;t feel obliged to drop a tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to Ko-fi in the blue button below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39; src=&#39;https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;&gt;kofiwidget2.init(&#39;To support my art and writing, tip me on Ko-fi.&#39;, &#39;#428beb&#39;, &#39;W7W4LKBRP&#39;);kofiwidget2.draw();&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to quickly share with you something I am immensely excited about. The project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while now, at Rebellion, finally got its reveal trailer. NDAs lifted, finally (well at least in small parts).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of fun and got to work with many super talented individuals on this game. It&amp;rsquo;s been a blast in creating and learning and I hope everyone gets just as excited by the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sniper Elite 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Here is my final post with finished presentation images and videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a lot of fun working on this and it&amp;rsquo;s been a very valuable learning piece as well. I hope everyone else had just as much fun and I want to thank all of you who stopped by in this blog for the kind comments and encouragements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Victor Fritsch for creating the amazing concept piece that this environment is based onto. Make sure to check out his profile and art in the links a bit further below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fly-through-video&#34;&gt;Fly-through Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my fly-through showcase video. I tried to make it an interesting one and worked a bit on the sounds too. I hope that you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention was to make the environment visible from multiple angles and have it as much &amp;ldquo;game ready&amp;rdquo; as I could. As such in this backside view I reused some of my assets to try some storytelling and showcase a part of the gateway &amp;amp; stargate that is damaged and malfunctioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mixed panning materials with noises and textures fed into normal, fresnels and refractions used onto multiple tori. On top I also placed a particle system I created in Niagara to give even more movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;callout-sheets&#34;&gt;Callout Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are some behind the scene shots. Starting with callout sheets of the assets and materials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-018.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Callout sheet screenshot. Showcases eleven sci-fi, hardsurface panels. Each has different greeble details, cables and metallic (chrome and gold) parts.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of 11 panels above was one of the parts of the project that took me the most time. I tried to created them detailed and interesting while balancing geometry and 2D texture details and hard surface stencils here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panels are arced when seen from above and are measured to be modular and snap perfectly when rotated around, forming a cylindrical structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-019.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another callout sheet. This time around the rest of the props used in the scene are overlaid on a checkerboard plane. These props consist of: portal, platforms, heads with eyes covers by cables, cable bundles for scattering, spline meshes, reusable pieces put into those splines.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I relied heavily on spline systems reusing the same few base meshes. By the end all spline actors were converted and baked into packets of static geometry so draw calls are minimal and the environment is optimized and runs well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-020.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Materials callout sheet. Consists of 4 UV spheres. Each has a different material applied: chrome metal, gold metal, cable material one, cable material two (looks like insulation tape). Below those is a cylinder with a material that has square greeble details. To the side of that is a flat plane showcasing hardsurface intricate details baked flat.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left you can see a trim sheet that is used in the background. To the right are hard surface stencil details and decals I modeled in Maya and then baked in Substance Designer in order to distribute across the arced platforms for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timelapse-video&#34;&gt;Timelapse Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also created this time-lapse video that combines screenshots taken in the process of making the envo in engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 12 - Bits and Pieces</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00253.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 12 - Bits and Pieces" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-angle&#34;&gt;Main Angle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last update before the very final post in the next days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00253.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle screenshot. The cylindrical portal megastructure. Colors are refined and the background has a bit more detail in the likes of chrome and gold, large pipes.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on various odds and ends. My main focus has been to polish anything that catches my eye and sticks out. Also to improve my storytelling in any further way I can. I tried to clean up the lights around the portal apertures as well. Lowered the blue leak but increased contrast when you look inside it and see the pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added a second layer of sorts to the portals&amp;rsquo; Niagara VFX I&amp;rsquo;ve been making. It&amp;rsquo;s white and yellow dot particles, spawned on a torus and accelerated to go inwards. Adds just a bit more movement and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;niagara-gif&#34;&gt;Niagara Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it in this heavily compressed gif here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-portal-finalized.gif&#34;
	width=&#34;994&#34;
	height=&#34;544&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up of the portal VFX. Lots of refraction and emissive dots swirl around in yellow colors on the surface of the tori otherwise in blue hues.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;182&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;438px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely to the very inside and middle of the portal, you can see a radial movement with polar coordinates. I added that yesterday as the previous one I had was just flat pan in U direction on a cap and it looked bit bizarre once you were to take a closer look and notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;malfunctioning-side&#34;&gt;Malfunctioning Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worked and polished a bit more the side with the malfunctioning portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00254.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The side of the portal megastructure that has an opening malfunctioning. Next to the long platform leading to the portal diaphragm, there are now cables and an empty floating platform otherwise used by people for transportation and maintenance.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added more cables on the platform, improved scale and texture on the existing few and added a &amp;ldquo;parked&amp;rdquo; levitating platform with some metal pieces on it, as if someone were in the middle of repairs. I also scattered few decals here and there to add variety and interest on the platforms that were slightly too pristine before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did yesterday was to add more lit up panels in the background using texture. You can see it in the first picture above. I vertex painted an emission mask with small dots here and there, to go on top of my original trim sheet used on the outer walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working on my final camera shots and movements for the video. My sequence is mostly done now.  I might add few more angles tomorrow, as once I record and go in the video editing software, most of the time I end up slicing and cutting half of the shots away anyway. I also have to take a look into some soundtracks and SFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone&amp;rsquo;s final sprint for the challenge is going well, and that it is not too stressful, haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next presentation post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 11 - Smoke and More Stencils</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/pd-or-11.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 11 - Smoke and More Stencils" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-screenshot&#34;&gt;Main Screenshot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how my scene is looking after some work from the past days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/pd-or-11.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle from Unreal, showing the cylindrical mega-structure and its portals. When compared to the previous post, the blue glow from the gates and the VFX for the portals is much more powerful. The piping on the ceiling and the floor now also give off smoke and vapour VFX, showcasing radical changes in temperature.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scaled around and made some of the pipes larger. I did that with the idea of filling up the lower and top empty space of the composition better. I also though it will improve the feel of the whole cylindrical portal and make it feel even more immense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vapour-vfx&#34;&gt;Vapour VFX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then moved onto introducing some smoke and vapor particles. I wanted that in order to give the scene even more life and make it feel bit industrial as well. You can see preview of that below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/voMcH5XL4ZE&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the raising smoke and vapour as seen from the main camera angle of the project.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smokes are Cascade particle systems that are mostly my own creation. I did however borrow the use of a flipbook (animation sheet) from a 3rd party as it was a bit of a stretch for me to make one from scratch in the little time left. It also would have looked horrible because I have no experience making or baking animations or FX onto singular frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then moved onto animating some sparks. I also damaged the hull of the inside of the shut off portal and made some aggressive fumes quickly leaving the pipes. See a preview here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLDSd4G274M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing another VFX effect. This time around its Niagara sparks that come off some torn sci-fi cables.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those sparks were made from scratch, not in Cascade, but in Niagara instead. If you fancy something similar there are plenty quick tuts out there and results are pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;portal-vfx&#34;&gt;Portal VFX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then tried to give more movement to the edges of the portal, especially as seen from profile. I did that again through a Niagara system. I spawn bunch of particles on a torus, have them on moderate lifetime and lower their opacity while apply directional velocity and killing them once they reach certain edge. The effect adds this to the portal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOtvuXOB81Q&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the portal VFX. Close up camera orbits the portal and shows dark, sci-fi smoke that adds more dimension to the edges where portal VFX meets metal props.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cylinder-surface&#34;&gt;Cylinder Surface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely on the overall surface of the whole portal, you might notice I also baked and added a lot more hard surface patterns and details. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make some of the otherwise empty surfaces even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00236.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Side angle of the cylindrical structure. Shows the malfunctioning, closed portal to the left and the open, working one to the right.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might do another progress update in the next days, before wrapping up everything in order to submit after that. I&amp;rsquo;ll start a timeline and animate my fly-through cameras, so I might show you some previews of that next. I still need to put in some better poses for the mannequins on the platforms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick update with some recoloring and some other details.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Main camera angle. Compared to the previous post this time around the atmosphere and the color in the air are revamped. Most of the colors are in blue and teal, blue, green-ish ting. The only other color is of gold and yellow lights dotted around.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original concept had blue tint while my vision of it so far was mostly warm gray. (If you would like a reminder of how the original concept looks, you can find it in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;blog one of the series&lt;/a&gt;). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to follow the concept word for word, but I could not stop but feel I might be missing out by not trying the colors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such after some experimentation I landed on the colors you see above. I liked those quite a bit more than the original warm tomes I had going on. I then went into trying to clean up the portal / event horizon VFX even more. The previous one was too emissive and noisy for my liking and I though it was too busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another angle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00227.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Side angle showcasing the cylinder device in a spot where the right portal is on but the left one is malfunctioning and off. On the left one, that was in red lights last time, we now see a tint towards white and yellow lighting.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see I cut out the concept of the red, warning like colors. I still want to convey the idea of the gate being partially broken and malfunctioning, but maybe going for red and alarming colors was too obvious and easy. Sure it worked out but I think there are more creative ways to do it, I just have to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gamut-analysis&#34;&gt;Gamut Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/color-gamut-peter-dimitrov-cap073.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1524&#34;
	height=&#34;528&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two screenshots. Left is the old view of the scene, with red lights. The right side is the new view, with more yellow and blue lights. Next to each of those screenshot is a gamut look analysis, breaking down the colors and showing them onto a circular color selection with the colors used highlighted. When looking at the version with mostly yellow and blues, the color selection is clearly much more controlled and limited.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;288&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;692px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gamut is much more limited in colors now and I think the end result is quite more harmonic composition wise. You can see a reading of it in the picture above.
I added some cut and exposed wires but I have yet to try adding some sparks and other animated VFX. That might help sell the malfunctioning concept without the use of the red color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baking-normal-details&#34;&gt;Baking Normal Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I went into making some more pipes for the background. I also made a depth fade shader that gives a force field like effect where some of the pipes go through. Then I went into creating some hard surface stencils and baked details to use and stamp in Substance Painter. I modeled them in Maya and then baked normals of them in Substance Designer. I took those normals to use in Painter. I have just a few going on now but I&amp;rsquo;m going to make more in order to cover some of the otherwise empty areas on the panel surfaces of the portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it below:&lt;/p&gt;

In the middle: those same 3D pieces loaded into Substance Designer and baked onto flat planes, producing 2D textures. To the right: the baked normal details used on some of the geometries in the scene.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progression&#34;&gt;Gif Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a GIF of my dances with colors:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 09 - Red Portal, Refractions</title>

        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00190.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 09 - Red Portal, Refractions" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lights&#34;&gt;Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00190.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main angle screenshot from Unreal 4. The cylinder large structure of the portal device is in focal point of the image. The openings with the portals now shimmer in additional emissive sparks on their VFX tori.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on a part of the cylinder in the back that from my previous angles was completely invisible. There was pretty much nothing going on there and I decided to try some storytelling by using some of my existing assets but in a slightly different way. I got the idea that maybe one of the portal gates in the back is malfunctioning. It could have gotten damaged during a spaceship passing. Now the portals&amp;rsquo; event horizon is closed. Red lights indicate of something being wrong. You can see it below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00193.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Camera screenshot from a bit further to the left from the one seen in the shot above. Here the circular portal opening is damaged. As such the portal is not powered and the VFX is not on. Instead the viewer can see an open cylinder. It&amp;rsquo;s eerie lit in red, as to indicate malfunction.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might make some cables that are cut and damaged and just hang in there in the red cylindrical part. I could also add some sparks coming out of them. Or gas with visible vapor from some of the wider pipes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extra-angle&#34;&gt;Extra Angle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00194.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot with an angle similar to the one above. This time though, camera is slightly above. It&amp;rsquo;s also much further away from the cylinder and portals seen, and with a much lower FOV, zooming into it but eliminating a bit of the perspective distortion.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some visible artifacts in the light bakes seen through predominantly black faces on some of the cables. I&amp;rsquo;ll fix that next though.
Now that I have this new angle I&amp;rsquo;ll have even more room for movement in the final video, which is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vfx-improvements&#34;&gt;VFX Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scaled few things here and there but then went onto experimenting in the VFXs a bit more. I wanted to try to add some refraction. I though it might be a nice way to add even more depth and interest in the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by adding just clear refraction on a sphere and then setting that sphere in a position similar to the gates. That produces the distortion that happens on the edge surfaces. A bit like what fire generates on its tip and hottest points.
I then liked so much how the refraction turned out that I decided to also revisit my panning main material for the event horizons. In it I was panning just noises and fresnel but this time around I also added refraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all you can see video preview here:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut from the main camera. Movement is static but the video showcases the VFX of the portal.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;orbital-stargate-peter-dimitrov-cut003.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made a Light Function that casts water-like caustics. The function is put on a point light that goes in front of the gates. Adds yet another layer to the VFX. I tried to keep color and opacity of it quite subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another preview:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Another video cut showing the refraction sphere in front of the blue portal even better. To the left is a red, malfunctioning portal.&#34;&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 08 - Platforms, Background, Optimisation</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00182.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 08 - Platforms, Background, Optimisation" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Quick update with a few things in my scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00182.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main angle camera screenshot from Unreal 4. Progress from last post showcases lots of splashes of gold and yellow on the surfaces of the portal cylinder and its greebles. There is also some of that, together with sci-fi, square grid wall textures, in the background.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, I spent my attention on mainly two things. First was working on the platforms that the humans sit on. I created a proper mesh to replace the previous placeholder. I also made a material with gradient I can tweak and put colors and noises on top of in order to get that force field effect. I experimented with a few colors for it but ultimately ended up with the one like in the original concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00183.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1098&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up screenshot of the floating platform. Its top and bottom are Zbrush sculpts showing metal with intricate carvings. In the middle of the platform stand 3 UE mannequins in an A pose. Around them is a strong, yellow emissive ring.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then moved onto the background once again. I tried to improve the protrusion bits I had placed previously. I wanted the hard surface to look proper and as if part of the room and like weld metal, as opposed to the previous golden supports that looked just like clipped through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00184.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1098&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot of the sides of the giant room, around the portal cylinder. The walls have square, greeble like flat texture with strong normals giving it dimension. Also occasional yellow lights scattered here and there. In the middle of the picture is a cylindrical opening and platform. That is where spaceships would float through, going towards the portal.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worked more on my trimsheet that I deploy in the background. I added a part to it that has panel-like details and greeble like features. You can see that above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optimization&#34;&gt;Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this takes us to today. Tonight I decided to try optimizing the scene a bit. I had spline meshes, non-static parts and materials in the scene that I wanted to improve tech wise. It would not be a successful video at the end, if I were to leave the performance as it were and recorded at 15 FPS. : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before. Constant at 75-80 ms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/Screenshot_2021-02-04_181630.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1297&#34;
	height=&#34;739&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;SCENE RENDERING screen shown in Unreal 4 Editor. Lists and details RenderViewFamily, Draw calls, and other profiling stats. Most important one here, for this case study, is the stat third from bottom to top: Mesh draw calls. In this picture it reads 1,696.45.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;175&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;421px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After. Stable at around 18 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/Screenshot_2021-02-04_184841.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1298&#34;
	height=&#34;744&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screen identical to the previous. Important stat is again: Mesh draw calls. In this &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; picture it reads 306.00.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;418px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some more clean-up and with no &lt;em&gt;stat scenerendering&lt;/em&gt; on, I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at a stable 10 ms. Quite better even than the previously mentioned 18 ms. This is not in standalone form so one could argue it might be even better there. I think for recording the video I&amp;rsquo;ll play a timeline through a cooked standalone project and maybe get a bit of a boost in ms from that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ms-comparison&#34;&gt;MS Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I think it will do for now. Here is one final comparison to an ms observation from a week ago to show you how slow it was, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/pd-opt-comp.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;993&#34;
	height=&#34;501&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two screenshots from the Unreal Editor. Left shows &amp;ldquo;stat unit&amp;rdquo; at 60.6 FPS, 164.97 ms (with hit mostly on GPU). Right image shows the same, but after fixes up. Reads 94.33 FPS, 10.60 ms.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;198&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress&#34;&gt;Gif Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But away from this, and back to visuals. Here is a GIF:&lt;/p&gt;

	height=&#34;548&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Gif progress from the usual camera angle. This time it mostly showcases progress on the background and the walls. First they had placeholder, gray materials, but then were replaced for greeble texture details.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly mention how exactly I accomplished the big win in performance above. I think anyone with experience can derive and make an educated guess, just by looking at my stat scenerendering profiling pictures above. Yet I write and share these posts with a lot of students too and I wanted to explain it a bit better for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the making of this project, I heavily relied on spline blueprints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When there is a long platform, be it straight geometry or cylindrical motives, instead of placing by hand a repetitive, modular piece, I would feed that piece into a spline blueprint system of my own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It made the art creation process much more quick and powerful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is one caveat though. When you work with spline blueprints like that you end up leaving all parts as &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be able to edit a spline curve on the go too, the nodes derive tangent points.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of those pieces stack up in draw calls. When you place one long platform that is a spline blueprint, instead of having say 1 to 5 draw calls you end up with 150-200, because of all of the spline components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you put an identical platform spline blueprint copy next to it, that gets its own 150-200 draw calls too. They don&amp;rsquo;t get bundle together with the first one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew this from the very get go, when I started adding splines. I knew I will need to go back and clean up and &amp;ldquo;bake&amp;rdquo; my geometry into truly static geometry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Before&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;After&amp;rdquo; screenshots above, you see me doing exactly that. I select my spline blueprints and I use the Unreal 4 Editor integrated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Actors/Merging/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That turns my one, super long platform (for example) that has 150 draw calls into one piece of geometry, that is say mid-poly, but is 1 draw call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I then reuse that super long platform, to the sides, by replacing the rest of the similar blueprints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t change the x y z scale of those copied platforms (otherwise the draw calls get separated again, even if not as bad as before).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doing even more actions, similar to the above description, I optimized the draw calls in my scene from 1,696.45 to 306.00.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That on its own got me from 77 ms (12 fps) to a 10 ms (94 fps).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unrelated to the Blueprints or Splines above, but if you are using the Unreal Geometry Brushes to block out spaces, bear in mind they have similar caveat of draw calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each of those brushes, in its nature to be editable on the go, comes with dozens of draw calls instead of optimized just a few calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I often come across student&amp;rsquo;s block out projects that run at bare minimum FPS. They often ask and wonder why that happens and most often my advise is either to bake down all of their Geometry Brushes to truly static, non editable geometry, or to start blocking out using primitive Static Meshes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have fun in Unreal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 07 - Relit Scene, VFX</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot000150.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 07 - Relit Scene, VFX" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-lighting&#34;&gt;Different Lighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back for an update with a different lighting and some portal VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot000150.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle, Unreal 4. Shown is the large, cylindrical portal structure. The gaps where the portals are, that were blank, emissive cards before, are now replaced for fluid-like VFX shader on a tori.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the scene from last time, most lights were overlapping and causing quite a few baking issues. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave them to Movable and as such dynamic instead of Static. Mainly because I want the scene to run well in real time so I can record a video at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the fact that my previous version was arguably making the whole greeble details very flat. As such I decided to completely revamp the lights. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with them now and performance is much better although I might brighten it up a bit more here and there with any future progress as I don&amp;rsquo;t want the scene too dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing the relighting I decide to have some fun with the portal effect itself. I also really disliked the fact it was completely white and empty as in my opinion it was breaking the picture a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vfx-video-showcase&#34;&gt;VFX Video Showcase&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut orbiting around the VFX and showcasing it.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;orbital-stargate-peter-dimitrov-cut001.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a custom shader that utilizes few Perlin, Clouds and Plasma noises exported from Designer. Few of those are b&amp;amp;w greyscale masks, but a few I also exported as converted Normal maps with crazy high intensity. The Normals I unpacked from Tangent to World space and I then feed into a Fresnel function. I exposed few parameters for tint, color, emission, fresnel power, fresnel emission and custom opacity control that lerps the b&amp;amp;w noises together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material I slapped onto a torus. It&amp;rsquo;s cut in half and some of the faces are prolonged. UVs on it are straightened and then when I put the material on it together with a UV panner I get the effect as if energy is moving inwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result that you see in the video above is just three tori, varying on size, overlapping one another, with three instances of the material graph that have slight variance in color, emission and panner direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In there you can see through the transparent bits of the portal some pipes and metal elements. I thought it would be cool if you could peek and it was not completely opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is me going bonkers with a spline and Duplicate Special set to instance in Maya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/dup-special-curve.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;Short gif from inside Maya. Showing use of &amp;ldquo;Duplicate Special&amp;rdquo; to edit a spline that is instanced. The relationship between the instances makes for a diaphragm opening and closing animation when editing.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;349px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was lots of fun and I recommend trying it if you ever do circular designs and your package of choice is Maya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-screenshots&#34;&gt;More Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can probably notice I did some work on the background too. I started blocking out some rooms and primitive details just today and I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing more of that tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to soon start bringing the background to a good level of detail when compared to the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 06 - Metals and Textures</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot000123.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 06 - Metals and Textures" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;texturing&#34;&gt;Texturing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Quick update with a latest preview of how the scene is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dived into UV mapping and some materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot000123.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main UE4 camera shot, showing the portal cylinder. Material and texture work can be seen, with the greebles now having metallic shine while cables appear rubber and blue and there are some golden trims scattered too.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the panels still don&amp;rsquo;t have textures. I went with silver/chromium look tied up with some gold and golden trims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;panels&#34;&gt;Panels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I managed to go through four of the panels and texture them. I laid them out on the same UV texture set so they share bitmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not completely happy with the detail, noises and colors on them, but I&amp;rsquo;m setting up everything with smart materials so I should be able to easily tweak all of them. I just need to UV map the rest tomorrow. Fun. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View of just the mapped panels plus the gate frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-cap073.jpg&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;153&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;368px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background I started with a trim sheet so I can easily introduce some patterns later on. Though arguably it will need some geometry there too as to not be too flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress&#34;&gt;Gif progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process gif:&lt;/p&gt;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll need to work more in order to balance the amount of detail on each panel through their textures. I want some panels to have golden elements too but I am going slow in order not to overwhelm it. Also I want to map and texture to the existing level the other 5-6 panels and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start trying the same changes uniformly on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to bake some normal stencils and decals that I will then stamp directly on some of the empty surfaces for some extra detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any comments are appreciated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 05 - Portal Aperture</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00093.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 05 - Portal Aperture" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aperture&#34;&gt;Aperture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys. Here is some progress on the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been making the past days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00093.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle from Unreal 4. Compared to the last blog post, now the greeble panels are much more populated with little details. The portal has a sharp fang-like aperture around it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual I spent even more time on the greebles and putting more detail on them. I made one or two new greeble panels and I am up to nearly 9 of them in total now. Two of which still have a few empty corners. I also struggled to reuse them in one or two places specifically, where no matter which one I put it became obvious there is repetition. So I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just make a final extra one before calling their number be set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sculpt&#34;&gt;Sculpt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some experiments with some details around the portal entrance itself too. I made an aperture-like piece that has sharp, fangs-like appearance. But before that I also made a sculpt of a face. It&amp;rsquo;s eyes are covered by cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-2021-01-20_232220-02.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1346&#34;
	height=&#34;616&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Maya screenshot to the left, showing the aperture cables and details. Zbrush screenshot to the right showcasing a human head sculpt that is then used as a sci-fi, H.R Giger-like detail.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;218&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;524px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sculpted it in Zbrush. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that much detail but arguably it&amp;rsquo;s not really needed for it to have any as it&amp;rsquo;s just a detail piece mounted above and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really need to be a centrepiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress gif:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-004.gif&#34;
	width=&#34;974&#34;

		alt=&#34;Timelapse gif showing the further build up of greebles.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fang bits have placehold gold material although I think I might keep a type of gold by the end too. On some of the greebles and most of the portal I will try some light and silver metals and as such I really want to try to contrast some gold pieces and details here and there too. For a renaissance or art deco in outer space kind of a style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00093-02.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The portal structure captured from a more lower angle camera, looking up. In the middle is a platform with yellow glow and humans. Shows the scale of the place.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start the materials and textures I&amp;rsquo;ll also tint everything towards more blue most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always forget to mention this, but I am thinking of later on having a go at some VFX and interesting visuals for the portal plane itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it completely white as it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. I&amp;rsquo;m back with an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-004/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00072.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Main camera shot. The cylinder now has panels nicely cut, showing gaps in-between. To the side is a small floating platform with humans on it. It&amp;rsquo;s lit in a yellow glow. The space has a lot more fog too.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly building up more detail. There is still quite a bit of empty surface area but I&amp;rsquo;ll be tackling that the next days. I spent 2 days doing just cables and greeble details and it was quite exhausting at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such today I took a break from that and worked on the overall picture, atmosphere and lightning. It&amp;rsquo;s not final but at least now I covered the big hole on the ceiling that I had in the placeholders. I had Directional Light coming from there and once I got rid of that everything went quite dark and I had to build it up bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good fun and I finally got to do some pipes on the upper part of the Stargate portal too. It was empty before but you could not see it because of the limited camera angle. I intend to have video with movement at the end and different FOV and as such I had to put detail up there too, I could not just ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting challenge with the Volumetric Fog. Once I closed off the ceiling and removed the Directional Light, the Volumetric Fog turned pitch black-like. You can see it in one of the steps above, though in movement&amp;hellip; oh boy&amp;hellip; it was much worse looking when flying around. I had to tweak a bit but ended up with result I quite like. I did not want to give up on Volumetrics and disable them because that removes my eerier blue glow I so much want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any materials, textures or colors. I am purposefully keeping myself away from that for now though. I think there will be plenty of time for that once I have all of the geometry and shapes and silhouettes in. That&amp;rsquo;s what I am focusing on now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know its bit too gray now but I&amp;rsquo;ll be playing with that soon, as a reward once I make even more cables. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00051.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 03 - Do 3D Artists Dream of Electric Wires" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An update on the Stargate Orbital Station with some work I did the past days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00051.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera screenshot, showcasing the cylindrical structure. Compared to the last blog update, this time around the portal openings have a frame around them consisting of wires and greeble details.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary focus has been the geometry around the portals and on the face of the cylinder itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building it up slowly with cables, fuse boxes and other details. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to increase the variety and fidelity even more once I block out the basic shapes on the faces that are still empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a gif of things in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-002.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;Gif showcasing a timelapse of the build up of the panels work on the structure.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I should approach the details on the cylinder as if they were greebles back when I picked the concept. I was worried that might make them look very squarish and nearly committed to just doing freehand placed geometry. I was having lunch next and I could not stop thinking that not trying more modular approach might be a mistake. I also had the imagine of this old puzzle toy my grandparents used to keep in their house back at home in Bulgaria when I was a kid. I could not get it out of my head. So I went back, took measurements and split the circumference of the cyl into few even pieces. I then started putting details on top of those pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/peter-dimitrov-progress-img001.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Three screenshots put next to one another. First one is UE4 shot that shows the cylinder with panels color coded to show the asset usage. Second is a hand holding an old Soviet puzzle toy. Third is the panel cuts from one, but this time showed in Maya with details.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toy I mentioned is seen in the middle. &lt;em&gt;(Googling an obscure, long word descriptions of it gave me a result saying &amp;ldquo;old Soviet puzzle toy&amp;rdquo;. Brilliant.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End result is a bit more modular and structured than just placing random bits here and there. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to produce a small library of 7-8 of these &amp;ldquo;arched panels&amp;rdquo;. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll build the whole structure through just them. I also decided I&amp;rsquo;ll probably not constrain myself perfectly into some of the panels so there is better feel of flow and it looks less forced into rectangles later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, somewhere by the end I could also produce few pieces of cables and other details that serve literally as foliage (but are not plants, lol) and are scattered in engine to give even more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cables&#34;&gt;Cables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, making cables and wires was fun, why would you ask? &lt;em&gt;Smile.&lt;/em&gt; Jokes a part the first few are kind of fiddly but then you build a small library of few curves and finished wires and you can easily knock out new ones through Soft Selection &lt;em&gt;(in Maya)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know they look very high poly right now, but I am keeping their back faces and proper edge loops for easy iteration. Once I start finishing the panels though, all back sides that are not seen are getting deleted, lots of the edge loops that don&amp;rsquo;t add that much flow will go as well. Result should be not too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next post,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 02 - Blockout and Splines</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00032.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 02 - Blockout and Splines" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;greybox&#34;&gt;Greybox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First project update from me. Here is some progress from the past 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00032.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;UE4 screenshot. Large, gray cylinder with gateway-like cuts. Inside the cuts are overpowering, blue emissive cards. Around are long, straight pipes and metal platforms that go outwards of the platform in all directions like chains.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been mainly blocking out the space and making sure the scale and placement is correct. Not many details yet, but there will be time for that later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I did the other day when I started was to block out some rough shapes directly in Unreal using the basic Brushes. Instead of dragging the shapes around, I used the settings tab and put in specific values for the size of each thing. What I had at the end of that day was pretty meh visually, but it was important that I had some numbers and measurements figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I went in Maya where I started the proper geometry, again using the values I had picked in the Brushes. After making few of my static meshes, I put them into Unreal with a gray, placeholder materials. I then experimented a bit more with fog and light and had a scene that looked a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress-gif&#34;&gt;Progress Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my tradition I started back a few challenges ago (with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-019/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Feudal Japan&lt;/a&gt; one) and export some progress GIFs and animations in some of my blog updates. Here is one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-001.gif&#34;
	width=&#34;974&#34;
	height=&#34;548&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Gif timelapse that slowly shows up the build up of the blockout from an empty scene with default Unreal 4 sky to what is depicted in the screenshot above.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I mainly created some of the shapes on the cylindrical room, as seen in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;splines&#34;&gt;Splines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipes, by the way, are made by a small cut section of a mesh I modeled in Maya that was then used in a custom Spline tool I created in Unreal. That enabled me to easily create all of the different shaped pipes you see. I need to bake them into proper geometry later on, as they are just non static Blueprints right now and that will cause issues with lighting later on when I start baking lights, but for now though, it will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone else is having fun with their scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 01 - Reference / Concept</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/Victor_Fritsch_LIGHT_final_ENV2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 01 - Reference / Concept" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;start&#34;&gt;Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I took a part in the challenges here &lt;em&gt;(this project was part of Game Environment/Level Art Artstation Challenge 2021. That is what I was referring to here back when I initially wrote this.)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start the gray boxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, here is the concept I chose to go with. I fell in love the moment I saw it and I think it fits very well what I usually go for visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-concept-art&#34;&gt;Main Concept Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stargate Orbital Station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and its a concept by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/contests/grand-space-opera-light-age/challenges/93/submissions/59200?sorting=popular&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Victor Fritsch&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for the lovely artwork, Victor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/Victor_Fritsch_LIGHT_final_ENV2.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;2D concept art depicting a large, cylindrical portal. Out of it come lots of pipes and metal details. There are spaceships and floating platforms with humans on them. The platforms are in a staggering contrast, all in yellow against the dominated in blue portal. Art by Victor Fritsch.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;250&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;600px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason I decided to go with this one is because I think it would be an interesting practice in hard surface and machine and pipe-like details. I want to push my hard surface skills so I though it&amp;rsquo;s ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;moodboard&#34;&gt;Moodboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my larger reference sheet. &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding to it later on)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/ref_sheet_peter_dimitrov_initial_ORB.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1617&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from PureRef where I&amp;rsquo;ve placed lots of reference images. They span from the original art by Victor Fritsch to other pieces by Alex Mordovets, Alec Tucker and H.R Giger.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;118&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;284px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece is of course Victor Fritsch but I also included a few other ideas and thoughts I have for my plan for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I included H.R Giger because I think it would be an interesting challenge to try to mimic some of the type of organic, but at the same time industrial feel he creates in his works. I also love the thought of the white silver/chrome, metallic look and I think I might try that for the surfaces in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From other challengers I included a piece by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/contests/grand-space-opera-light-age/challenges/93/submissions/57899&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Alex Mordovets&lt;/a&gt; as I want to later on try to have some kind of a visual effect inside the portal gate. Alexs&amp;rsquo; piece has a black hole as the focal point and I though that is an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another artist I included, that I came across on here on Artstation is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/WKrk9D&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Alec Tucker&lt;/a&gt; with his Viscera project. His work is very masterful and I love the gritty, film grain look in the final piece. I will try to have my artwork tid bit brighter but I think there is lots I can learn by Alec as long as I keep an eye on his piece whilst I work on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make this one final post, to wrap up the last eight entries of the series. I want to do that so I have the opportunity to sort of mark and number the entries, as blogs can sometimes be a bit chaotic, and it might be hard to keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can see a gallery with the finished work over at my&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9eOVKo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;The making of everything seen above is documented in eight blog posts, that I wrote between January and May of this year. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read them, now is your chance! I&amp;rsquo;m sure there would be some intriguing insight in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember the scene from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, you would probably notice that it looks completely different. That is, looking at the atmosphere, at least. The layout is more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mist&#34;&gt;Mist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this idea, of having mist just above the surface, since the very start. I purposely postponed it until now, though, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get crazy with tweaking volumetric fog settings, alpha and fog cards and putting crazy amount of time in it, whilst not having the basic layout figured out or any of the props ready. But now, when nearly all of the props are ready, I had the time to sit down and work on vapor and smog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone wanting to recreate this, the ground mist is just a very large &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particle Emitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Its tied up to a &lt;em&gt;Clouds texture&lt;/em&gt;, pans a tiny bit, has a pretty short lifespan and is spawn cylindrical. After that its just a matter of tweaking your &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volumetric Fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; settings in your &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exponential Height Fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; volume. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure the guy in Epics &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd7-rTzfmCo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(14th minute mark)&lt;/em&gt; about Volumetric Fog in the Engine quickly recreates something very similar. The only part I added myself, is how I placed it in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s just below the surface of my Landscape. And that&amp;rsquo;s how I made it look like ground mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov15.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stained-glass&#34;&gt;Stained Glass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, very important addition since last time, is the Stained Glass material that I created. It&amp;rsquo;s made from scratct in Substance Designer. What you see here is version 2.0, as the first one I created, I abandoned after a bit, as I though its shape was too simple. It had a diamond pattern going for it, and I wanted something more intricate looking than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov16.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Angled, closer shot of the cathedral. The tower and the right wing of it have a strong, mostly purple stained glass in intricate hues and patterns.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main approach to it was creating a base pattern and then picking up different areas of it and applying a few individual &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flood Fills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Each Flood Fill is turned to Color and then the hue, saturation and lightness of each shape that the Fill has picked up is randomised. The tricky part was giving it a shining look afterwards, in the Engine. If you look at just the material &amp;ldquo;ball&amp;rdquo; in Substance, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much on its own. To give it that emissive look, I masked just a small portion of the whole patter. I applied another Flood Fill (by now third) and gave it sharp, stained masked noise with a Slope Blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov17.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up shot of the stained glass. Circular motives that overlap into one another. Each different circle is colored in a different hue, raging from a lime, dark, cold green to an electric but warm red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m particularly happy with this approach, and it gave me one thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate and wasn&amp;rsquo;t aiming to achieve. If you look at the texture up close in Unreal (the screenshot above), the emission mask is distinct and clear (white magenta bits). As you start going further away from it, though, the Engine shrinks the texture quality a bit, which blurs the emissive pixels. Those pixels then, start to work together with the Bloom settings of the scene, and fill the whole glass surface with a dark, electric, blue color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-008/28_peter_dimitrov_neon_gravestones.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1452&#34;
	height=&#34;855&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from Substance Designer showing node set up that creates the above described colored circles for the stained glass. The screenshot is focused on &amp;ldquo;Flood Fill&amp;rdquo; nodes.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;169&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;407px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As I described, you can feed an outline of your pattern towards a Flood Fill. You can then use a Flood Fill To Color to randomise the HSL of each generated shape. You can see all of that in the screenshot above.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are making a strained texture of your own, I would suggest experimenting with emissive mask, but also pay attention to your Bloom settings in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Processing Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A good combination of both, always makes for exciting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pattern of the texture, I was in parts inspired by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/blogs/steppenwolf/306A/substance-designer-random-things-3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matthias Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; techniques, which he shares over in his blog. Check that out too.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things are ready by now. I still have a few objects to put textures to. The boxes that you can still see are placeholder for hopefully some statues of something looking like a weeping angel. I want one or two of those, to contrast the very straight shapes of the rest of the headstones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also still working on the details of the main gate that you can see in the very first shot in this post. Facade details around the big window too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this project has been quite a fun journey. I think this will be my last post about it though. As long as it goes about approach explanation at least. My next one &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;hopefully&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; will be a gallery to showcase the final result. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on the video, to showcase the casket as well.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Casket as seen from a few posts ago, as I have a feeling some of you probably don&amp;rsquo;t even remember it. It&amp;rsquo;s still here! Going to animate it for a final video.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I started this project a few months ago, is my university. As such I&amp;rsquo;ll be submitting it as a thesis in about a week now. So that&amp;rsquo;s the deadline by which you will hopefully see the final result as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress-gif&#34;&gt;Progress GIF&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Some of you know I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of progress GIFs, so here is a very compressed final one.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those of you who you stuck with me through the whole journey, and read all of the previous entries (about eight), I want to say thanks. I hope you found them useful and intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Neon Graveyard - 07 - Neon Signs</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/05_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Neon Graveyard - 07 - Neon Signs" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-006/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;casket&lt;/a&gt; prop, I&amp;rsquo;ve had time to go back to the overall scene and continue working on missing props and details for the landscape. The other thing is refining textures and figuring out how exactly I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle making the neon signs. Previously, my neons were just simple alpha cards with an emissive text. Although in its core that&amp;rsquo;s what neon signs look like anyway, I wanted to put more attention and detail into them than just that. Possibly build a more complex material shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the last two posts were about the casket, it&amp;rsquo;s been a very long while since we&amp;rsquo;ve last seen the scene as a whole. As such I am just going to show you at what stage I am right now, and then we can talk about how I created the different bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scene&#34;&gt;The Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/05_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A look at the scene from the main camera angle. There are more neon signs on the mausoleums and the cathedral. They also now illuminate in electric colors the surroundings, as opposed to before when they were casting no lights.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just as a reminder - this was we had before (three weeks ago or so):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/04_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The main camera angle again, but this time from few weeks ago where there were much less neon sights and color everywhere.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;neon-signs&#34;&gt;Neon Signs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From close up, this is how the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; sign looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov11.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up on one of the mausoleums entrances. A neon sign with the text &amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo; is attached. It  glows in blue and purple neon colors. Tubing of illuminated neon wrap around the sign metal mounts.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a few GIFs to show the animations I&amp;rsquo;ve put in the signs. (gifs are heavily compressed as Artstation caps the file size at a very low amount).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/back-up-gif-peter-dimitrov-compressed.gif&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Gif of a camera orbiting around one of the mausoleums. On its top there is a neon sign attached that reads in English, and in Russian at its other side: &amp;ldquo;Back Up Your Conciousness&amp;rdquo;. A floppy disk neon switches on and off between two states, giving it a moving animation.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;176&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;423px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/new-iden-gif-peter-dimitrov-cp02.gif&#34;

	height=&#34;272&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Yet another mausoleum. This time to the side of it is a holographic-like sign. It reads &amp;ldquo;New Identity&amp;rdquo; and then pans to the same text but in Russian.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;176&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;424px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to make some even more dynamic, by having letters flick. The metal mounts of each sign still lack textures, but that will be for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov12.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up static shot of the &amp;ldquo;Back up Your Conciousness&amp;rdquo; mausoleum and its red, neon look. On the lower part of the image there is also a red sign in Mandarin.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text that&amp;rsquo;s lit up is in Russian and reads the same way as the English one next to it &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Backup your Consciousness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a play on words as well, which I will animate for the final video. The idea I have in mind with that is about the text in Russian, appearing lit up fully at first - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Сохраняйте свое сознание&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The whole sign then flicks on and off a few times, as if short on electricity. When it powers up again, its left with just &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;охраняй сознание&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. First and last two letters from the first word are off, second word is entirely off. And what we are left with reads from &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Backup your&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Guard your Consciousness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I made the alpha cards of the neons into 3D objects. I made a few of the texts into actual geometry, but then when I inserted them in, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell from afar that they are dimensional and 3D. Going up close to them, most still looked relatively the same - flat. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided that there is no really point into turning them into expensive on memory 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain text with an emissive material was flat as well, and as such I went into trying to figure out another way to make them look better, more dimensional, and more neon-ish. That&amp;rsquo;s when I though of trying a transparent text with a border. I then put a second border to that said border. The inner border, I assigned bright color together with emission. The outer border, I left dark. The fact that they are transparent from the inside, boosted the illusion of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;neon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. What I discovered then, is a trick I made up which turned them actually dimensional &lt;em&gt;(sadly probably not very well seen in the GIFs due the small image size)&lt;/em&gt;. I duplicated the text as it is in the world in the engine. I then offset its position by a few pixels backwards from the original position. To that second copy, I then applied an instance of the original material. In that instance, I can change the previously exposed parameters such as the colors of the inner and outer borders, as well as emission level of the glow. Then, by changing those colors, to ones completely different from the original, I managed to create an illusion of depth. The result is best seen when you move the camera while looking at the signs from a side. The secondary colors, from the text copy that is behind, leak and bloom softly. They contrast so well with the front text, that whilst you move, they make the whole text appear as if an actual neon, with dimension and shifts in the value and hue of its color. That effect is apparent even from the static shot seen above, that showcases the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; neon.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;409px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The borders, I created in Photoshop using Blending Options - Stroke. To keep everything optimised, I suggest making those masks into a single image. In the image above, I&amp;rsquo;ve put the two different borders, onto two channels - one on Green, the other on Blue. In the material shader, I simply take those channels and assign them color and emission value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve showed you how I do this with a single text - &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; taking a whole bitmap of 512x512, but for this project, I actually keep every text and neon design, into one single image. In a 2k texture, you can fit much more than you would think, and using every channel - R, G and B - allows for even more effects and optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zbrush, I imported low-poly models of headstones that I created in Maya. I turn them high-poly by dividing the geometry with smooth off. I then sculpt detail on that and when I am happy with the result, I create a new, low-poly version, by decimating the topology. For that, I use Decimation Master, that can be found in Zbrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov14.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headstone seen below, I decimated from 2.3m tris to 2k using Decimation Master. When you go to poly that low, you can freely take the model in Maya, and UV map it by hand. 2k tris is not too much, and as such the automatic mapping in the newer versions of Maya does quite a good job. It takes most of the flat surfaces and gives you whole UV islands, and it leaves just a few weird triangles here and there, that you can quickly sew back in place. Small edges with lots of damage on them, usually get mapped weirdly too, but you can go over those and fix them with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;409px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of giving the weird letters on the headstones, actual metal mounts and have some cables run towards them from the ground. Right now they sort of give the vibe of magical runes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-things&#34;&gt;Other Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the landscape I&amp;rsquo;ve scattered some detail using small rocks, broken pavement as well as some cables. I&amp;rsquo;ve created the cables as a spline system, and although it took a bit of time to place as many copies as I&amp;rsquo;ve done, it was very fun to do. Obviously, I tried having them glowing at first, but decided against it as it was getting a bit too much in the way. Their texture might still need some more work though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cathedral in the distance will still need some more attention. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of some decals and props to scatter and give variety and detail both to the roof and to the walls. The windows will have stained glass material to them, with an emissive mask. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to achieve some electrical whimsical colors, to fit the Cyberpunk vibe. I&amp;rsquo;ve left them for this late on, as I already have plans on how to create them in Substance Designer. Working on materials like that is probably one of the things I enjoy most in 3D, and frankly said, that&amp;rsquo;s why I am keeping them as a treat to myself after I get the rest of the important things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you found this post insightful and interesting. Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; you a just completed as far as it goes in terms of geometry prop. The weeks after that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent on creating materials for it and actually texturing it. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few changes on the overall scene as a whole too, but this post will be once again mostly about the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cyberpunk Casket&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-casket-in-unreal&#34;&gt;The Casket in Unreal&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a slow process as I&amp;rsquo;ve been making everything from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building up my own &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; of materials as well as alpha masks for shapes like the writings, protrusions, retrusions, labels and more decals of such style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-006/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov04.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Zoomed look at the casket. The fans and server devices are visible in a close up here. Decal and texture work is more obvious too, with things like a large number 64, a barcode and other writings and warnings in English, Bulgarian, Japanese.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I build scenes in Unreal, they rarely consist of props made to be scrutinised from very up close. I knew from a long time, though, that I want this model to be the focal point of my showcase video. I want to tell a story of sorts, and this prop will be my main actor. That is why I&amp;rsquo;ve went quite higher in detail (both in geometry and texture density) than I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-006/peter-dimitrov-neon-gif01.gif&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;172&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;412px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the prop sits at a bit less than 17k of geometry. I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy about that fact, as I though it would be much more costly. The fan piece is understandably expensive (500-600 tris), but its instanced and as such is loaded into the memory only once. I call it into a custom Blueprint to animate it so it spins around.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;materials&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are previews of a few of the materials I created for this prop. Some are actual final materials with full bitmaps channels for PBR, but a few are just patterns I created and then used in Painter to blend more normal and height detail into the prop (an example would be the dotted pattern).&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First material is the one I used the most. Its a plastic with a simple anisotropic noise to give it a better feel. Taking it into Painter, I&amp;rsquo;ve duplicated it, changed its color to lighter, changed the direction of the anisotropic filter and I&amp;rsquo;ve put a smart mask on it. The result is not seen here, but can be seen further up, in the first screenshots. I&amp;rsquo;ve build up the fan material like that. Second is a triangular pattern I used to give some visual noise. Most of the time it might not be noticed as I&amp;rsquo;ve put it to around 20-30% opacity. Just enough to build up some interest. Dots are what you see on the servers, and the last one is electrical tape for the cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iray-renders&#34;&gt;Iray renders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some screenshots from renders I ran in Painter. Bit fizzy here and there and with quite a few white pixel artifacts, but this will do for now. I will make better passes at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more interesting part though, is that I started development on the gravestones.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea from the very start of the project, was to create a spacious environment and then showcase it in some interesting video with nice camera movements and maybe even some basic animations. While working on the layout and general mood, I was thinking all the time on what I want to do with the gravestones themselves. I knew I wanted to turn them in some weird, cyberpunk devices that serve a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first look they appear ordinary (apart from the neon signs, and the disc looking device) but upon close inspection you see there is something that might be going on with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-concept&#34;&gt;The Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holes of the gravestones will look like any ordinary ones. The camera zooms into one though and some movements starts. The entire hole, in which a casket would go, starts moving up. Pressure release sounds plays and some vapour particle systems triggers. With the upward movement we suddenly see the side of the &amp;ldquo;coffin&amp;rdquo; and realise that there is something weird to it. Lots of wires run through it, connecting cooling systems and servers together. Lots of small lights flick on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle prolonged shapes (seen in the picture above), I want to give the look of as if they are storage space (digital ones, of course). Hopefully I will find a nice way to wire up the gravestones with some cables that go towards the cathedral itself. If that is visible from the main camera, the viewer could have a hint towards those gravestones way before the camera zooms in and the whole sequence I described plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very front of the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;casket&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I put a terminal. Going to have some fun animating the screen with some weird numbers and code showing later on. Also, texturing that keyboard should be quite interesting too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to have this whole prop be quite more detailed in both geometry and texture, compared to what I ordinary do. In a way that its obvious that its a prop, meant to be inspected from very up close in a first person game. I&amp;rsquo;ll still do my best with optimisation too, nothing is going to be too crazy (the spinning fans, which are the most heavy on geometry objects, would be an instance of a single object, and I will animate them to spin in the sockets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve UV mapped a big chunk of it already and I hope to have some interesting stuff to show next time. In the meantime, tell me what you think of the idea and the general look of this &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;casket&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; so far. Hoping to bring it to life with lots of cyberpunky lights and wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the UE4 prototype. Angle and subject is similar to the shots in the previous posts. Here, however, the visuals and tiles are more finalized. Big sun star to the left, throwing aggressive light on the gray tiles to the right. The light is more defined and the &amp;ldquo;shadow&amp;rdquo; areas are now much more obvious.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;462px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last post we mentioned the most important Blueprints we need in order to have actual gameplay. They do build the win/lose condition, but we still need one more very important element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need what I call right now, and am going to refer to, with the word “blocks”. The blocks are the pieces that go on the environment to cast shadows here and there. The blocks are what the player is in control of, as I said way back in the first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tetris-pieces&#34;&gt;Tetris Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game, I have tiles, that put together create the map/surface area. Then, on top of those, go the blocks. They fit together perfectly in slots, as I need it to be visually explicit where a player is allowed to place and where they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_022.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;232&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;557px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First “sketch” of the shapes I did in Maya. It was a quick test to see what shape could work the best. At that point in my mind I already knew I wanted one shape repeated many times like a tile, but I still was not certain what that shape would be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_023.jpg&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;142&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;342px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I did anything, I had a quick sketch, that does not look very impressive, that I made in Photoshop. It was more of a guide for the mood, that was assuring me I am going in the direction I want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could probably see that the image I produced above, was what inspired me to go towards a blue starry sky, overall dark tone, and a very bright sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also sort of see the path, illustrated in blue, and the idea of going from point A to point B as a main objective in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sun&#34;&gt;Sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had figured out the visual of the tiles, and the Sun next to them, the first draft was a hollow, holographic looking star. Although I said I don’t have plenty of time to create textures and shaders (thus the tiles are textureless) I still needed to make sure the Sun has a texture. The Sun needs one, because it is a main game mechanic element. We need to be able to tell, visually, that it’s big, that it’s hot, and that it is potentially dangerous. It can’t simply be hollow. That is when I went into making a texture and some basic animation for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My reference sheet (or what others call a mood board) for the Sun. You can see the giant Sun from Destiny 2 on a few different screenshots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final visuals of the sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun is created from two spheres that go inside each one. The outer one is a low poly, with a Fresnel Shader applied to it. It gives it the triangular holographic look, that flickers with a subtle animation. Inside of it is a proper texture, unlit Shader, that has an animated normal and some glow too. Both materials can be controlled for a change in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_026.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;715&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot similar to the previous one. Three spheres but now each has different color. First one is green, second is a discordant combination of purple and blue and third one is overpowering yellow with splash of tiny oranges. &#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;429px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different colors of the stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some levels of the game could have multiple suns different locations. In that case I can have selection of colors so each is unique, more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-block-pieces&#34;&gt;Back to the Block Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What those needed was a “placement system” Blueprint. It was good that I knew exactly how I wanted that. That’s, again, thanks to the traditional RTS games. What I ended up making is simple in words, but more complex in Blueprints. It’s a system where you can click on a block to place it, it becomes semi-transparent and red (again with the help of a Fresnel function). If you point to a tile, that is marked with a Boolean that says “True” for “Is this tile Place-able on?”, then the transparent color turns green. It also lets you place it on top if you click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system for that is quite complex and I genuinely would have to do a few posts to find a way to explain it like a tutorial. Something, for which sadly there is no time right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also have to thank my brother, Miroslav Dimitrov, who is a programmer and helped me figure out the logic of a few things I needed to do, so I could properly turn them into Blueprints. I am sure he did not find it as amusing and fun as I did, mainly because he writes in code, has no idea how Blueprints work, and had to just guide me and watch me struggle on my own with Unreal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guide for anyone that might want to make a system like that is to look into &lt;strong&gt;Get Hit Result Under Cursor by Channel&lt;/strong&gt;. That is basically a line trace that goes where the location of the mouse cursor is. After you use that, do a check to what object the mouse is pointing at, and then have your IFs to change color, check if placement is possible and et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_027.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1280&#34;
	height=&#34;711&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the game showing the tiles and a sun next to them. The mouse cursor is hovered over a specific tile that has a triangular gap inside. With the mouse being there, a holographic, green, obstacle tile shows on top. It&amp;rsquo;s an indication that the tile is a valid placement. (like in an RTS)&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;180&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;432px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pointing the mouse at valid slot tiles makes the block green. Red for not being able to place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blocks-visuals&#34;&gt;Blocks Visuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to mention, that given the blocks are so important and the player interacts with them, it would make sense to have textures and proper interesting models for them. I would love to do that, but for now just a different color will have to do. I will go back to it and maybe model out something, given that after I completed all of the important Blueprints I need, and I make a few playable levels, I am left with some free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research on how the blocks could potentially look just randomly walked through my door one day. Or more like not my door, but the door of the university building I am in during classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful statues, courtesy of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cherylvollorceramics/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those intricate ceramic statues, painted with acrylic on top (if I remember correctly) are created by &lt;em&gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/em&gt;. I met her randomly in the first showcase room here at UCLAN in Preston. To get to the studio of our class, you walk through an entrance, small “hall” of sorts, where every week different art displays are put on. That’s where Cheryl had the exhibit of her statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I first saw them, I suddenly imagined some of the maps of my game to be like that. A weird, alien environment, with peculiar crystal formations and colorful blocks that are in a juxtaposition with the dull monotone colors of the surface. The player could pick up those blocks and move them around. This whole thought came to me way before I had done any prototyping and it just sparkled a lot of excitement in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Cheryl, who was amazing, and let me use the visuals of her statues in any game I created or for any research I would need. Thanks again for that, Cheryl!&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another picture of ceramic sculptures. This time around not only is the ground in whites and blues/purples but the protruding parallelepipeds also have those colors. They are also angled in an uneasy fashion, as opposed to the first picture where they were nearly perfectly upright.&#34;

    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I said, we will sadly have to wait to see if I get some free time to “upgrade” the visuals of my blocks with anything remotely similar to those pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you found this visual research intriguing. Next we will look into the first playtest with actual living people, that my game saw! Woah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly update this entry to mention that there was no &amp;ldquo;next time&amp;rdquo;. I wrapped up the project by adding a few extra levels and having it all then playable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will admit to you though, that the game prototype was behind, priority wise, on the list of my other works, given I had at the time focused on crafting an Environment Art portfolio to try and find my break into the industry later that same 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such I put most of my attention in &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo; (both of which you can read in detail about by using the &amp;ldquo;Category&amp;rdquo; buttons to the right whilst on the main page of this blog).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did, however, create a &amp;ldquo;trailer&amp;rdquo; for the game, as part of the course. I never got to writing another entry to these blogs and showing it there, but here it is for you:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;game-trailer&#34;&gt;Game Trailer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgjCF3PDWnI&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No mention of &amp;ldquo;vampires in space&amp;rdquo;. Kind of a missed opportunity, 2019 Peter! Instead just &amp;ldquo;Astronauts&amp;rdquo;? Oh well&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see in the trailer that I tried to keep it humorous and easy going, as I thought then, and still believe that would be the right course of action for the game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2019 20:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/</guid>

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots showcasing the path with the unit (astronaut) on it. There are red ground textures in this one, but I stepped back and returned to a more clear visual style late, mainly because I wont have much time to work on visuals. Its all about Blueprints and game mechanics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;important-blueprints&#34;&gt;Important Blueprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to become a playable game, I need three crucial elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is the camera. Unreal Engine 4 does start with a few presents of options for camera. You can have first- or third-person instantly set up with proper Blueprints. In this case, though, I need a system for a camera that is more close to the properties of one in an RTS game. I want the player to see everything from above, at a sort of isometric view. That preset does not exists and sadly I will have to build my own, from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two is the path, on which the player unit is going to walk. The player themself are not exactly that unit, they are not the astronaut. They don&amp;rsquo;t control the astronaut. At least not in the sense where the player moves them around with inputs like arrow or WASD keys. Instead, on the screen UI there is a button. It says “Walk”. The player presses that and the Astronaut starts walking along the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/chromosphere_pd_016.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from an UE4 widget / ui and ux editor. There is a red text block and a button with text &amp;ldquo;walk&amp;rdquo; on it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;219&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;526px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walk button as seen in the game, next to the Health Pool display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three is a Sun blueprint. In it would be stored the information of when the player should take damage. In this case, I’ve created a array of elements. I reference those and then cast a line trace between those elements (in this case, they are spotlights) and the Astronaut. If in-between those there is any element blocking the trace, then I can come to a conclusion that the Astronaut must be in shadow, and thus should take no damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all of this, lets look at each one individually once more, but this time more in detail when it comes to the logic and the blueprints themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera&#34;&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/chromosphere_pd_017.jpg&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;395&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;950px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve created my own Pawn blueprint. In it I’ve placed a camera that moves together with the movement of a ball. The ball is set to be invisible, with no collision and through the Blueprints I move the ball around. The camera follows it and thus becomes functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four ways to control that movement. Three are quite simple and the 4th is a bit more complicated. First and second are controls through the arrow keys of the keyboard and through WASD. I’ve mapped those to axis movement input in the Project Settings, and then I’ve called those keybindings in the blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third way of movement is panning. You click right mouse button with the cursor of the mouse anywhere on the screen and you drag around - the map drags with the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth was the most complicated one. It’s just like the one in a traditional real-time strategy game. You point the mouse at the edges of the screen and the camera moves in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get that working, I am calling a function in the Blueprints that is there by default. It is called &lt;em&gt;Get Mouse Position on Viewport&lt;/em&gt;. See, the screen is composed out of numbers. Sort of mapped in X and Y coordinates. Just like the illustration I’ve included above. The functions returns those X and Y and I check their value. I create 4 cases, sort of mapping the screen in 4 sectors. Or 5 I presume. One is the very middle where nothing happens. The 4 important sectors are those in the edges. If X and Y correspond to numbers that are in those 4 sectors, I then know the mouse is there and next I move it in the correct direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/chromosphere_pd_019.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blueprint editor screenshot. There is a &amp;ldquo;Pan Camera&amp;rdquo; custom node that leads into &amp;ldquo;Get Mouse Position on Viewport&amp;rdquo; that then gets split into a Sequencer Node into 4 cases. Each case then goes into a respective IF branch of == (-&amp;#43;) X Dir or == (-&amp;#43;) Y Dir.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of the blueprint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images hosted here are for some reason tiny, and I know that you probably wont be able to see very well each individual node. But I believe you can follow the logic following the colors of the links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Edit: this was initially hosted in another web where images are smaller. One above is bigger, yet I know its actually still not easy to follow what is seen, so I apologize for not having a higher resolution for you.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything goes in, running on an &lt;strong&gt;Event Tick&lt;/strong&gt;. After all, I need to check where the mouse is all the time. Going in, it then plays a Sequence hooked up to 4 IFs (branches). You can already guess, that those 4 ifs control the test where the mouse is. In a case an if branch is true, it sets a value of 2 Float variables I’ve created. &lt;strong&gt;XDir&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;YDir&lt;/strong&gt;. I set those two to -1 or 1. And with their respectable combination, it yells 4 results to where the mouse could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have enough time to take screenshots of each node and showcase it well. Or to explain the logic node by node. As this is not really a detailed tutorial. But I do hope talking about the logic behind this blueprint served to be of some help to anyone reading.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The spline system seen in the Engine. The visuals are outdated and the shaders I am using look kind of weird. Still you can see the system demonstrated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a similar spline system set up, you can follow &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUxM0NDWRY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Mine is identical, with the difference that I’ve also included a player mesh that moves on top of it (Astronaut).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part about this system is the fact that the spline, with its points that I can add, remove and move around dynamically, allows me the freedom to set up multiple levels. It’s like a sandbox system ready to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invisible line traces are cast all the time to detect collision. In this image, I’ve made them visible for illustration purposes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line traces are cast from a function called &lt;strong&gt;Line Trace by Channel&lt;/strong&gt;. Its pretty straightforward to use and I am sure you can find plenty of resources about it. Its &amp;ldquo;Start&amp;rdquo; is Sun, and the &amp;ldquo;End&amp;rdquo; is the Astronaut BP Actor (the mannequin). Small tweak I’ve done is that the start is not just the Sun, but its an array of Spotlight Elements. That way I can place a spotlight anywhere and have it referenced as the starting point and thus have more control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be it for now, hope you found this insightful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next post we are gonna explore some thoughts on models, visual language, props and the map itself. Stay tuned,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-game&#34;&gt;A New Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been into the making and prototyping of a game from scratch the past bit less than a year. The topic of it was open, and it was up to me to decide what exactly I want to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go into what the game is about, its story, genre and so on, I want to spend a few lines talking about my initial few other ideas. The ones I went through before deciding to go with the one that I am working on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rules-so-to-say&#34;&gt;The Rules. So to say.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I making the game? What are the requirements towards it? Well, for one, making games is fun. I am an artist and a designer, so why not apply all of my skills in one place and make a whole game? But there is more than that obviously. I need this game for university. This is one of my graduation projects for BA (Hons) in Games Design at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uclan.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/games-design-ba&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, Preston, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as rules go at uni, well there is a big and important one. I have to develop everything on my own, from scratch. And that is what dictates the strongest the reasoning to why exactly I chose this idea out of the total three I had initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-idea-01&#34;&gt;Initial Idea 01&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Rupture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_002.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Rupture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a game idea I came up with together with my brother, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-dimitrov-17592a107/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Miroslav Dimitrov&lt;/a&gt;, in the distant past year of 2013. The project was created in the span of a single weekend and a bit. 72 hours. For the famous game jam website &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ludum Dare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. You can see our initial submission over at our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ludumdare.com/resources/archive/compo/?u=ludum-dare-27/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the game was simple; you are a time traveller, who created a time-travel machine. You go on said machine and start to teleport through different time dimensions, going in the past, future and so on. Though the very first teleportation though, something goes wrong. The machine breaks down and pieces of it spill around you. Ten seconds pass and you are suddenly teleported somewhere else. At every teleportation you can go around and collect random bits of metal and machine pieces. Those increase your score. When the ten seconds go through, you must be back on the machine. If you are not at it, it teleport itself without you and you are suddenly stranded. You lose the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot 01 - The player finds themself stranded in 2nd Century. Somewhere in Northern Thrace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the game was kind of elegant in its simplicity. And as it is with most nice things, it was born out of prerequisite, not out of pure wit. The condition that birthed it was the rule of the game jam. Its theme which participant were bound to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme read:
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_004.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I though it might be cool if I were to recreate the game. 3D low-poly art with some interesting light effects and particles. Assembled in Unreal Engine 4, programmed there with Blueprints. Props modelled in Maya, texturing in Substance Painter and Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to back up the idea, we really did get quite a good score at the competition back in 2013, proving that there is potential in the concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_005.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;170&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;408px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We placed number &lt;em&gt;69&lt;/em&gt; for the theme. Out of a total of &lt;em&gt;2213&lt;/em&gt; game entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really though the idea is simple and I would be able to recreate it and even improve onto it for the one year I have at uni to develop everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that sort of stopped me is the fact that I am an artist and designer, but not much of a programmer. I can do simple visual scripting in Blueprints (which came out to not be very simple in the current state of the project, but we shall see that in the next posts), but I can’t really code anything complex in any language. And I wanted to be able to do justice to things like spawning different mechanical parts and elements into the world, using some algorithm a bit more complex and elegant than what I can sadly do on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to my teachers and they said its fine if I have some help from outside. With the programming that is. As long as I keep all of the art and design elements/mechanics completely from me. And so I knew I could bring my brother to the project, and have him program a few algorithms for me. I decided to leave it to that though, and explore more ideas and maybe stumble across something I can execute more independently, just on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-idea-02---running-out-of-space&#34;&gt;Initial Idea 02 - Running Out of Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model in Maya that I created as an initial proof of concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this game I didn’t have a working title, but again more of a working theme. Again from Ludum Dare &lt;em&gt;(you can probably already guess I sort of really like that event and game jam website :P)&lt;/em&gt;. The theme was &lt;strong&gt;Running Out of Space&lt;/strong&gt;. And it sort of aligned with some ideas and notes I had been doing prior to going in the jam. The jam was held during a weekend in August, 2018. We didn’t manage to create anything playable or to submit anything, but it was still a nice exercise of generating ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial notes and a quick sketch I did back then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_008.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;483px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial camera view I tested. The game would be a 2.5 side view, where in 3D space you assign units what to do. You gather and manage resources and space people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some additional ideas that I though would fit perfect into this game concept. But there was one thing - in a staggering opposition with everything I said previously with the &lt;strong&gt;Time Rupture&lt;/strong&gt; game idea. It’s the fact that, if I were to make this game, a sim in genre, where you deploy all kinds of units around the ship, it would require really importantly on one important thing. That thing is artificial intelligence. I would need a good AI. One that would control the units and make them move around the ship. It would let them execute the tasks the player has given them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that was an idea more complex in programming than anything else I had though about. And even though I am keeping it in my records as a project I might go back to on day, it was by no chance appropriate for university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-idea-03---light-is-dangerous&#34;&gt;Initial Idea 03 - Light is Dangerous.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Light is Dangerous&amp;rdquo; later turned into &amp;ldquo;Chromosphere&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_009.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Text screenshot reading &amp;ldquo;Theme Voting Round 3&amp;rdquo; and 16 words and phrases under, that are the themes. One of them is &amp;ldquo;Light is Dangerous&amp;rdquo;&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;114&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;275px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down to think about a third idea. This time around the main condition: the idea needs to be simple. Execution should be possible just on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had nothing to get me started and that’s why I took this screenshot you see up there. Its a near final round of voting for a theme. A theme for another Ludum Dare. Not sure which one or the date. But it still listed 16 themes and I though that is enough ideas to get me started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took and combined &amp;ldquo;Shadows&amp;rdquo; together with &amp;ldquo;Light is dangerous&amp;rdquo;. Ye, they both kind of sound like a cliche, but I though it might be fun to explore what I can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I came up with was a puzzle game. One where you, the player are not in control of a character. Instead you are in control of the environment in which the protagonist is. The character is stranded on a piece of land. Maybe somewhere in space. Next to them is a giant sun. A star. It emits light so hot, that if the character steps in it for far too long, they starts taking damage and then burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial sketch and notes of the idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_011.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow note in pic above reads: &amp;ldquo;You are a spaceman&amp;hellip; who is also a vampire. You are in open space and you&amp;rsquo;ve lost your helmet. Help the vampire get to the end and retrieve their helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the side read: &amp;ldquo;Goal is to retrieve a space suit helmet. - Goofy, easy-going story.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Harder levels could have multiple units (spacemen), who walk different paths at the same time. Makes it more complex.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trigger pressure plates on the paths that manipulate the environment on the go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Specific part of the path goes to night? Day-night cycle?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the first page you can read where I took inspiration for the idea: during the summer, just before going back to uni, I build myself a new desktop PC. I needed a powerful GPU (I used an integrated one before that) in order to handle all of the graphic 3D work I was about to start doing in Unreal (for stuff like this project). The video card I got came with a free copy of Destiny 2. I hadn’t played it before that, but given how gorgeous and heavy in graphics it looked, I had to try my new GPU on it. I sunk in quite a few hours playing it and had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one particular level of its missions that stuck with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;destiny&#34;&gt;Destiny&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere001/chromosphere_pd_012.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concept painting by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/dorje&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Dorje Bellbrook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that mission you are on a ship just past Mercury, right next to the Sun. At some point you have to get to a specific part that is locked. You are forced to go outside the spaceship and walk on its exterior. That walk stuck with me because it had the mechanic where you had to stay in the shadow bits of the map. It was super simple and wasn’t challenging as a puzzle or anything. The game is a FPS shooter after all. But there was something really beautiful in the giant sun that you could stare right into too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I though about a few systems that I need to have to get the game working. Then decided they are not too complex for me to execute in just mere Blueprints, no programming language. That is when I got on board with it and started developing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first proof of concepts I did quickly in Unreal 4 back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prototype-screenshots&#34;&gt;Prototype screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks of developing after that got me to this visual style and a few systems in.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk about how I got to this stage and what my blueprints are in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you find reading this interesting. Keep tuned,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past week has been kind of slow as I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with a few other things (like playing &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; :P). I did some work on detail pieces and protrusions on the cathedral. Then I had a go at making some initial textures in &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put in a tessellated landscape blending material in, ready to take on a few more textures when they are ready. The muddy one you see is one I created for my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Feudal Japan&lt;/a&gt; project. I think I like the wet, reddish look though, so I might keep it like that but give it more variety with a second texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facade&#34;&gt;Facade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did figure out how I am going to approach the facade of the buildings though. Or at least those of the ones in the distance, still not certain about the mausoleums. I decided I will make some basic brick textures, make a few variations and vertex paint detail on top. But that will be kind of too flat and boring. As such I am going to make some decal planes to go on top, and those I will model in &lt;em&gt;Zbrush&lt;/em&gt;, the bake between two flat planes in &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt; and color/texture them. If I manage to make some interesting stone ornaments and create a good normal map out of it, it should give plenty of definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-004/06_peter_dimitrov_neon_gravestones.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1607&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Maya screenshot showcasing the cathedral main body and its stone carving details. On the left and right are some real world photo references of the same stone motives.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;170&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;409px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue bits are where the alpha cards/decals are gonna go. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely scatter more than what is seen above, but that is just an initial sketch of the idea to guide me along the way. The photos you see to the right and left are what I will try to sculpt and place on those alpha cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-004/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Close up shot from Unreal. The cathedral appearing at an angle. There are textures on the walls but the roof and stone details onto the walls are still gray placeholder.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here you can see the brick texture I quickly made in &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt;. They are famous, brick textures, aren&amp;rsquo;t they. Or I feel more like infamous. Everyone, pro or amateur alike always has a point of their career where they make one. I guess this is another one of mine going down in the records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bricks&#34;&gt;Bricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-004/07_peter_dimitrov_neon_gravestones.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Two UV spheres with materials on them. To the left is one that is gray bricks. To the right is the same brick pattern but now damaged in orange grime.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;170&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;409px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;em&gt;parallax occlusion&lt;/em&gt; shader for the bricks in &lt;em&gt;Unreal&lt;/em&gt;. It gave it a very good dimension but then I decided I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bother spending ages making a vertex paint blending material that is also parallax occluded. Not only will it be super expensive performance wise, but also from the distance shot I am going for, you can&amp;rsquo;t really notice the detail it gives. It was a nice exercise nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might spend more time in &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt;, making a few more brick variant textures. A few maybe quite different than the ones above. More smooth, with jarring whitish color and greater variety in roughness. I&amp;rsquo;ll then blend those on patches on top to give even more variety. And if it still looks flat I might even invest in a few patches of brickwork that is actual geometry. I&amp;rsquo;ll make them sort of modular/kit bashing in fashion and then scatter detail with them on the facades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, when I hope I will have more exciting than now progress,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-003/02_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

		alt=&#34;Little path leading to the neon cathedral. To the left of the path there are now a bunch of mausoleums with neon signs attached to them.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been blocking out more shapes and changing the lay-out quite a bit. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest and say that I liked the idea of having bare land to the left of the camera, and filling it with just squarish, ordinary looking gravestones. Exactly like the cover of the short-story I mentioned in the first post. Then in the distance, I would have spooky, aggressive treeline. And although trees are nowhere to be seen yet, I was worried that they wont fill the scene up enough when I create them. I was bothered that there would be this huge patch of sky to the left, and it would distract the viewers eye out of the canvas, instead guiding it towards the inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crypts-and-mausoleums&#34;&gt;Crypts and Mausoleums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to introduce some crypts, instead of having only gravestones. And even better, their prolonged silhouettes and roofs would give me more space to put on some neon signs. I had the intent to have lots of those lights from the very start. At some point I started wondering where I am going to put them, and this kind of fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-003/05_peter_dimitrov_neon_gravestones.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from Maya showcasing two crypts and mausoleums. One has a triangular roof. The other one is flat and more modern and brutalist looking.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;122&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;293px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They need quite a bit more detail and work, but at least their block-out shows me where I am going with it. With the neon billboards I want to suggest a story. Thus the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Cheap Cloud&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. The place doesn&amp;rsquo;t look very techno heavy a part from the lights right now, but I plan on scattering some cable and wire details through some &lt;em&gt;Unreal&lt;/em&gt; spline systems. They could go out of the cathedral and go towards each grave. Maybe those graves actually serve a purpose? Is there something in them? &lt;em&gt;Servers? Storage space?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out all of it yet, but just asking those questions and suggesting those ideas help me build the place up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, by the way, that &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; text font to the right looks maybe a bit too &lt;em&gt;Art Deco&lt;/em&gt;, and might really be calling for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2d-sketch&#34;&gt;2D Sketch:&lt;/h2&gt;

		alt=&#34;Quick and rough paint over image. There are symbols and neon texts attached everywhere. The cathedral in the distance has a strong red, glass surface of its windows, indicating an intricate stained glass appearance.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanna have a go in &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt; at making the emissive, colored, stained glass on the windows at the distance, but that will have to be for later as there is much more to do before that. Also I settled down on the idea that it might be cool to have a tower in the middle of the canvas. That needs to be blocked out next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress&#34;&gt;Gif Progress:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for a GIF!&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really unsure whether to keep the graves face the camera like I had them initially. I think it was not that bad but certainly feels a bit banal at times. Like, lets have every cool thing look straight into the eyes of the viewer. What I&amp;rsquo;ve settled down on right now, I believe looks more dynamic. Might still not be the final, as I feel like their placements lacks structure. Even though I am trying to convey the idea that its an old place and the soil started shifting and thus moving/distorting everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s for this time. Hope you like where its heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days passed since the last blog post about the project. I am back with some progress on the blockout. The first very notable thing is that the church (or more like cathedral, judging by its size, scale and type of architecture) actually looks like something now. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on it quite a bit but we are still in the phase of weird mixture of modelling bits that are finished but need texturing and tiny bit more detail, and others that are still placeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-002/02_peter_dimitrov_neon_gravestones.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;124&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;299px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been tweaking the scale of the different volumes for each part of the building. I don&amp;rsquo;t want it too massive, as I am limited on how long I can work on the project. At the same time I don&amp;rsquo;t want it dull and tiny. Above you can see a view from Maya. I don&amp;rsquo;t have it as one big chuck in Unreal. I&amp;rsquo;ve split it into multiple files so I can optimise the textures and light maps better later on.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;422px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial idea was to have all kinds of graves with variety of gravestones on top scattered all around. As such I&amp;rsquo;ve been modelling some of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will most likely still be tweaking their position so I can make the best composition in the main shot of the whole place. I&amp;rsquo;ll also work on more detail with the texts and neon on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripts-and-symbols&#34;&gt;Scripts and Symbols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I promised in my last post, lets dive into what exactly the writing that I&amp;rsquo;ve put in right now stands for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial idea was to change the inscriptions on each gravestones with a neon. I though I might try a fancy looking script. The ones that can be seen in old-fashioned movies and neon signs. Then I started to wonder, what would I write on those gravestones? Names? I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s what goes on gravestones, right? I decided I will have to create some random, obviously fake names (so no one sees a name of someone they know and gets creeped out, or even worse, offended). And because I want variety and more &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk-ish&lt;/em&gt; vibe, I thought I might try a few different languages too. That&amp;rsquo;s when I decided it might be fun to try something very, very old. To try to use a script that exists and is real, but is no longer in use.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;383px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I looked back into my native language for some inspiration. &lt;em&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/em&gt; uses &lt;em&gt;Cyrillic&lt;/em&gt; alphabet. To quickly introduce you to it, I&amp;rsquo;ll quote Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The early Cyrillic alphabet was developed in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School by Saint Clement of Ohrid and Saint Naum and replaced the earlier &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glagolitic_script&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Glagolithic&lt;/a&gt; script developed by the Byzantine theologians Cyril and Methodius.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, next time you see &lt;em&gt;Russian&lt;/em&gt;, you will know that their script has origins quite deeper and further away, into lands different from their own, and more close to those of my home, &lt;em&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/em&gt;. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have you here to bore you with History lessons. Soooo, back to the topic at hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so called &lt;em&gt;Glagolitic&lt;/em&gt; script is what I was after. I thought that its weird visual look might add quite a bit of interest to the scene. Another fun detail is that I can actually write real phrases with it, as &lt;em&gt;Glagolitic&lt;/em&gt; has its script correspond to &lt;em&gt;Cyrillic&lt;/em&gt; letters with exact match in sound and use. But I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will dive in that too deeply for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going away from scripts and languages, lets mention what the neon sign on the very top of the building stands for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to have different symbols and signs in neon on the top. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought of multiple ideas I might try later on. One was to create a logo and design that implements the infinity symbol in it. To sort of broadcast towards the viewer the idea that this cathedral is a place of &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt;. Old and abandoned but afterwards &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;repurposed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, as I said in my last post. And maybe, in it, in this &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; world, people cheat death. They augment bodies to make them immortal. If said bodies get damaged irreversibly, maybe they transfer consciousness into new shells. I decided infinity sign might be a bit dull and is kind of overused. That&amp;rsquo;s when I remembered about the &lt;em&gt;Ouroboros&lt;/em&gt;. Which basically translates to the same idea, but looks much more mystical and cool, we can agree I am sure. And when I was searching for some inspiration on that, I came across by a wood sculpture detail from &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrea Brustolon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It implements the idea of a snake eating its own tail, and also has a woman body in it. What a cool idea, I thought!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make my own version and convey the idea of infinity through the creation of new bodies through science. But I will have to work more on the designs later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress-gif&#34;&gt;Progress GIF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because I just love GIFs, lets have one now and see the progress so far:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Neon Graveyard - 01 - Start</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/HighShot00011.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Neon Graveyard - 01 - Start" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;idea-and-research&#34;&gt;Idea and Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new environment, I decided to share the creative process with anyone out there that might have an interest. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to share a lot of development images. Not only I want to show you the thing though, but I want to tell you about it too. As such at times I will be wordy. I hope that if nothing else, you find it at least intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are making quite a sharp turn, going from way back in &lt;em&gt;15-16th&lt;/em&gt; century &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Feudal Japan&lt;/a&gt; to the not so distant future. A ruined, probably abandoned cemetery. On the very top of its hill, a chapel stands proud. But there is a weird, modern twist to this. The world in which this place resides is a &lt;em&gt;gritty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; world. One full of neon signs, electric colors, rain and vapour. The churchyard has been repurposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First screenshot looking at the project. Yep, you are not wrong, there is nothing of what I described above as an atmosphere in this. Not yet at least. This is an early greyboxing level phase. But before I show you more screenshots, in this first blog post, I want to first talk about the source of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;neon-lights&#34;&gt;Neon Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the initial idea (that changed a lot) from a magazine that I grabbed from a shop I randomly visited at the centre of London last summer. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of store, where you see an original Marvel comics from now nearly a century ago displayed at its showcase window and you immediately think that its a place you gotta walk into. The magazine I bought is &lt;em&gt;Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact&lt;/em&gt;, or that&amp;rsquo;s what it used to call itself back in November 1972. That&amp;rsquo;s when the issue I got was first published. It&amp;rsquo;s cover painting is what allured me to buy it though, more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/analog-1972.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;665&#34;
	height=&#34;954&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Photograph of the front cover of the magazine Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact, Nov 1972. The name of the magazine stands in bold, yellow lettering whilst in the background there is a cold, blue painting. The painting depicts a large, tank-like machine. In front of the machine are lots and lots of gravestones.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;69&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;167px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;retro sci-fi&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; vibe of the painting. &lt;em&gt;Cemetery World&lt;/em&gt;, it said. By &lt;em&gt;Clifford D. Simak&lt;/em&gt;. The illustration is by &lt;em&gt;John Schoenherr&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Mother Earth the star-flung humans returned for their final rest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the worldwide Cemetery was something far more sinister than a burial ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And far more dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will spare you a lot of details. The very cool one though, the shoulders of which the whole story stands on, is the idea that Earth is turned into a cemetery. Humanity expanded throughout the Solar System and then into distant planets and stars. Earth was left. Abandoned. Civilisation remembers it though, and whenever someone passes away, they are sent back. They are carried through countless light-years of distance and buried on Earth. And so the planet is turned into a &lt;em&gt;Cemetery World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the story Earth is sort of flat lands and wherever you look what meets the eye is only gravestones. There is a bit more than that, of course, but I will skip it for now. But I recommend everyone to read the story if they like the sound of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I read that, I got the idea for a 3D work. A landscape where everything is filled with gravestones. And if its mainly gravestones, I thought, then it might not be that time consuming to create. As such I left it in my mind, as a sort of quick 3D project to go back to later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I started the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-019/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Feudal Japan&lt;/a&gt; challenge that I mentioned. And for the 2 months whilst making that, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the cemetery idea out of my mind. And while working on Japanese architecture, I listened to quite a few albums on a loop. And one of them was &lt;em&gt;Twenty One Pilot&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; new one &lt;em&gt;Trench&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard the album, you will know where I am going with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album features songs with quite the odd names, and then even weirder lyrics. But that&amp;rsquo;s what I, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure everyone else that listens to them, loves about them. One of the songs goes by the name &lt;em&gt;Neon Gravestones&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MeQ9rA2Ifg&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;♪ ♫ &lt;em&gt;Neon gravestones try to call for my bones&amp;hellip; call&amp;hellip; call&amp;hellip; call&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; ♪ ♫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I heard that lyrics, I got the mental image. The churchyard with the countless gravestones. A chapel on top of the hill. And then the best part — everything was in neon lights. A mockery of death of some kind. On top of the church there would be neon lights advertising something. The gravestones, instead of having ordinary chiselled inscriptions into the stone, would have neon lights too. I then knew I want to have a go making a 3D environment out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-light-james-turrell&#34;&gt;More Light. James Turrell.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to research more visual aspects, before doing any block-outs. Light is of a very big importance in this project, and I was worried I wont know in what direction to go with it. As such I gathered a few reference sheets, with countless of neon light signs and lots of electric colors. That is when I came across the name of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Turrell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across an art installation by him. One that deals exclusively with light. And even better, it has a chapel in it. It&amp;rsquo;s situated in a cemetery in &lt;em&gt;Berlin&lt;/em&gt;, where supposedly notable German figures like &lt;em&gt;Hegel&lt;/em&gt; are buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/03_neon_ref_sheets_JAMES_TURREL.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;141&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;339px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy I stumbled so randomly upon &lt;em&gt;Turrell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; name. The elegance, with which he uses light, I am not so sure I will manage to replicate. But still, the idea itself, will help me turn into the right direction for my environment. I read more into &lt;em&gt;Turrell&lt;/em&gt;, and found lots of amazing aspects of his work about which he talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my work, light is not so much something that reveals as it is itself the revelation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no object in my work. There never was. There is no image within it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would love to have a go at replicating that feel. I know it wont 100% work in my case. I am going to be modelling props and making fancy architectural elements on my buildings. I will light them up in the fashion that he does, but they will be the object. At the end, my work wont be as elegant and simple as his. Going for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;, there will be a clustering of light unlike what we see with his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still very happy I got to read about his work, because it made me think of light in a different way. Instead of as a tool, as an object of interest itself. In a case where we don&amp;rsquo;t care about what it illuminates. We care about the light itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-progress-shot&#34;&gt;Another Progress Shot:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, given how lengthy this already is, I&amp;rsquo;ll just show you to what point I got after all of this research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/HighShot00028.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a weird circular neon sign and even more weird symbols in front of the gravestones, but I will talk about those next time. I will also show more in detail how I got to this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you find what you are seeing and reading interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Towards the end of December 2018, few weeks after I wrapped up my project &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I was approached online with an invitation to write about my process of creation. The invitation came from the creator of a website I had not heard of until then. The web was called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IndieWatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I loved the idea and quite honestly was immensely flattered that someone took the time to write to me, let alone invite me to be featured onto their website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Few years later this website closed and as such my article is sadly no longer up online. In order to bring it back to you here, I used a snapshot from 2022 as captured by Internet Achieve&amp;rsquo;s Wayback Machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Dimitrov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I am a freelance illustrator and painter, who in the last 3 years stepped in the realms of 3D art. I started studying at the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Preston, UK)&lt;/em&gt;, pursuing bachelors in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. That is where I started to practice 3D for the first time (started around 2016. I will be graduating first quarter of 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was invited here, to write an article about the development of my latest, and as of now, first published 3D project. My debut in the medium, so to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final disclaimer before we begin. In this article, I will briefly mention certain techniques but will link resources towards their use. I encourage you to look into them. Sadly I am limited in the number of things I can explain, as there is only so much I can cover without getting overly lengthy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the project is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Animal Shrine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It is an entry for an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/contests/feudal-japan/challenges/51/submissions&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Artstation Challenge&lt;/a&gt; going by the topic of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feudal Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. But before we go into any explanations, I invite you to take a look at the full finished project, over at my portfolio, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/aRoa1k&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The project was created from scratch in 49 days. That was the length of the challenge. We were prohibited from using any libraries of 3D models or textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software&#34;&gt;Software:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I will start by introducing you into my use of software. We all know that there are multiple programs out there, and a vast amount of ways to accomplish a certain task. My pipeline is an amalgamation of software that I’ve been taught to use at university plus lots of (and predominantly) self-taught techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole project is put together in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unreal Engine 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve used one of the latest versions right now &lt;em&gt;(4.21)&lt;/em&gt;, deploying features ranging from being vital – for example for the look of my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd7-rTzfmCo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Volumetric Fog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; particle system; to small and relatively not important ones, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/SunPositioner&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Geographically Accurate Sun Positioning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which I ended up not using at end, but is still a cool thing you can look into).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every prop and texture you see is created by me. For their making, I modeled most of them in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autodesk Maya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. At the start of the challenge, when I had more time, I turned every model into a high-poly one in &lt;em&gt;Maya&lt;/em&gt;, and then moved it into &lt;em&gt;Zbrush&lt;/em&gt; in order to increase the poly count even more and hand-sculpt some detail on the surfaces. I would then decimate the final result, and bake it into the low-poly version that I had UV-mapped prior to that. For mapping, I used the new &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRaKwaQ9JAw&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Maya 2017 upgraded&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; UV editor. I got a few comments on how it must have been crazy mapping everything. It indeed was, but probably the sole reason I managed to make everything in the tight deadline of the 2 months we were given, was this new UV editor. A lot of stuff in it is automated and saves tons of time. One big example would be the feature to scale every UV island so that they match the texel density. Something, that prior to this would be done by eye, by applying a checker-board texture, and scaling up and down everything by hand, trying to match what you see. Well no more. By the end of the challenge, I sadly had no more time to hand-sculpt every detail. As such, I started to bake high-poly on low, without sculpting anything on the high. Might sound pointless, but you still generate Ambient Occlusion, Curvature and Thickness Maps, and they can be vital in the quick making of textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about baking maps, its good to mention where I do that. I used &lt;em&gt;Substance Painter&lt;/em&gt;. Baking any kinds of maps in that program, &lt;em&gt;Normals&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ambient Occlusion (AO)&lt;/em&gt;, or anything else, is literally like a child’s play. Use of &lt;em&gt;xNormal&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Maya&lt;/em&gt; for baking maps still exists in the industry, but I see no point in that, given that we have &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt;. Making your maps in it would be only a matter of firstly making sure that your UVs are created in a good way. Then, secondly, you turn your low into high-poly, export them separate making sure that they match locations. Most of the time you won’t even need a cage file.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a lot of materials in &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt;. Those would be basic textures like wood, gold, paper, stone, ground dirt and so on. I noticed that I am very picky when it comes to wooden textures, and as such created around 2-3 very different in visual look materials. I wasn’t sure on which one to settle down, but it all turned out good as I realized that I can just combine them in different ways after importing them in &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt;, and achieve a lot of variety. I will share a few tips that require a bit more advanced knowledge in &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exported every material as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;( * ).sbsar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I then imported that for use in &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt;. Its crazy how much you can do, if before exporting, you expose the right variables. In &lt;em&gt;Designer&lt;/em&gt;, the work you do goes into final nodes called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outputs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. My suggestion would be to run your final results for each node into one final node before that. Expose said node and then have control over everything. For example: for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Color&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, get your work into a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HSL Node&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, expose the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, expose the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and expose the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Put that into the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, expose the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intensity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Before the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roughness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; output, put a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; node, and expose every single aspect of it too. Now save that as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;( * ).sbsar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Import it to &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt;. When you open it there and apply the material to part of your model, you will see that suddenly, if you don’t like the color, you can go in the parameters of the material (whilst still in &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt;, no need to go back to &lt;em&gt;Designer&lt;/em&gt;) and just tweak the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HSL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; sliders to your liking. You might import the finalized model into &lt;em&gt;Unreal&lt;/em&gt;. Suddenly you see that it’s too shiny for your liking. You can go into the material in &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt; again, and control the Levels you exposed in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roughness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and tweak everything to your liking once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the stuff I said about exposing parameters might come out as a bit basic. But if you are smart about it, with just a little time investment you can create so much more. I created those basic wood materials you see and then exposed their color and roughness. Then, in &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt;, using &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Masks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (deploying the &lt;em&gt;Curvature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Thickness&lt;/em&gt; masks I’ve baked), I combined different types of wood, changed their color and roughness, and basically created a few materials that inside &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt; I packed as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Then whenever I had a new model, fully baked, I would just slap that &lt;em&gt;Smart Material&lt;/em&gt; on top and have a very good looking base to work off of in just a few clicks. For a project with such a tight deadline that was very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only software, that I’ve used and not yet mentioned, would be &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpeedTree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of self-explanatory by their names, I used &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4f7uGCdhPI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;World Machine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create the mountains you see in the background. I am very much a beginner when it comes to that software, having picked it up for the first time only for this project. Still, its node based design, much like &lt;em&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/em&gt;, was not hard to navigate at all. I created a very basic looking mountain deploying different noises. From the software, I exported a high-poly base model. You can work on the texture there too, and export bitmaps, but I had no time to dive into that. Instead, I took my high-poly in &lt;em&gt;Zbrush&lt;/em&gt;. There I decimated it to low poly and used &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObStsHYxags&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;UV Master&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to generate UVs. I took both into &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt;, baked channels, and used those channels to color it. It’s very easy, because stuff like the peaks of your mountain, go on a very specific value on the &lt;em&gt;Curvature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Thickness&lt;/em&gt; bitmaps. As such, using some of the &lt;em&gt;Smart Masks&lt;/em&gt;, you can pick the very tips of the mountain, and color them in white, to have snow for example. Change the value of &lt;em&gt;Roughness&lt;/em&gt; to be shiny, and suddenly in under a minute, you have a very realistic looking mountain. I imported the model in &lt;em&gt;Unreal&lt;/em&gt;, and just spinning and scaling it around, faked some variety and very long mountain range by reusing the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foliage&#34;&gt;Foliage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the foliage you can see is created in &lt;em&gt;Maya&lt;/em&gt;. The bamboo tree you see close to the camera in some of the shots is assembled in &lt;em&gt;SpeedTree&lt;/em&gt;. The tree in the very distance is again created in &lt;em&gt;Maya&lt;/em&gt;. For their creation, I used a pipeline very well explained by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/EQQbA&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karen Stanley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I made basic low-poly leaves and grasses in &lt;em&gt;Maya&lt;/em&gt;. Some of them, I took into &lt;em&gt;Zbrush&lt;/em&gt; for some detailing. Those high-poly models, I then took into &lt;em&gt;Designer&lt;/em&gt; and having created a low-poly base plane and a cage, putting the foliage props in-between them, much like a pressing a flower between the pages of a book, I baked maps from which I colored and created my foliage textures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This about covers the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;painting-and-2d-mediums&#34;&gt;Painting and 2D Mediums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is much I have no time to go through, as it would call for the writing of multiple tutorials and not just a single article! There is only one final note left that I want to make. When working on an environment like this, pay attention to how &lt;em&gt;the whole&lt;/em&gt; place looks. Look at the whole picture. Make smart decisions about your &lt;em&gt;layout&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;silhouette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that your buildings and props make. Look around with your camera and try to capture dynamic shots from the very beginning, even if most props are just gray-boxed placeholders. If your composition is boring from the very start, even the most detailed and pristine model, modeling and texture wise, will not fix your problem or make the picture look better. I feel like all of this is something that can be much more obvious in &lt;em&gt;painting&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2D&lt;/em&gt;. Study composition making in &lt;em&gt;illustration&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;photography&lt;/em&gt;, even if you don’t have much of an interest in those mediums. They still can teach you a lot and improve the quality of your 3D work exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;450px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I can give you a good example of this project. I started the whole thing by containing it into one big rectangular shape. That would be a second, elevated level to which you go through some steps at the very front. I did lots of research and reference gathering before starting the project. My research told me, that in Japan, they indeed made shrines and places like the one I am creating, very contained, fenced in a very rectangular way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believably like that, did not change the fact, that even though I had some buildings even on another scaffold level, the whole place still looked very boring. I would fly around trying to pick some dynamic angles. I had few, but still not many, and even those came out a bit boring. At that point, as suggested by some friends and people over at my university, I decided to take a few of the buildings I had created to the ground level, and separate everything even more. That’s how the final layout was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timelapse&#34;&gt;Timelapse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I capture a lot of screenshots during the development. I assembled lots of them into one final, dev video. It overlooks the place in an aerial type of shot, before changing to a closer camera. You can clearly see what I explained there. You can watch it over on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTylr2hF59c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure to write this, and I do hope you find it useful and insightful. While working on our entries for the competition, we were requested to keep as detailed as a possible blog. To sort of prove that everything is indeed our work. You can go and read mine for some more tips and insight.

&lt;p&gt;Here we are. The end. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it. This is the first project of such a big scale that I&amp;rsquo;ve done in 3D, and it was quite the ride! As I promised, I worked a lot on a video, in order to show you the idea of the whole place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Animal Shrine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; As some of the Japanese texts I have on the walls of my calligraphers workshop suggest, this shrine is a place where you can leave gifts and pray to different animals. At first, it sounds like it is a thing for fortune, and good health, but read deeper and you shall come across sentences like &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those who bring gifts shall have powers&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Point at your enemies and the animals shall follow&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The commander of the animals&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I say anything more, here is the video. Enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-flythrough&#34;&gt;Video flythrough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vi0vBi39h2g&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japanese culture, as well as in lots of others, the animals I have depicted have a very common appearances. In Japan rabbits are thought to bring fertility, cranes were thought to be immortal and as such were considered secret. Frogs, some say, bring luck. All of that is referenced on the walls of the calligraphers, but I wanted to take it further. See if I could come up with something more mysterious and weird. And then actually have a go at executing it and telling it as a story through a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite the challenge, I will tell you, and I redid that video about 4 times. Unreal&amp;rsquo;s Sequencer gave me lots of trouble too. It was good though, that along the way of making my props, I was exposing every single parameter possible. That gave me control over the colors of the lights, and the glowing eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not take 431 screenshots, in order to have them unrecorded and not seen&amp;hellip; This is not all of them, of course, but I made sure to take lots of specific angles through the making, and them combine them in a video. Hope you find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with this shot above, but I am leaving it down here, in the hopes that you first see it in the Video, and won&amp;rsquo;t get the whole surprise element spoiled.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now lets go to some technical talk. I recorded the scene in real time. The FPS is around 40-50 constant, but would occasionally drop down to 25-30 when looking through the cameras that overlook absolutely the whole place. I think you can feel a few frames drop on the first video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I was kind of convinced that I will not be able to record anything in real time, given that I am pushing my models and textures to appeal visually at their best. LODs are something I would love to do, but maybe not in a short challenge like this. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to be very reasonable with my choice of texture sizes and my stacking of multiple objects on one texture sets. My machine is not bad, but it is by no means top-end either. I have a strong video card (gtx 1070), but pretty outdated CPU and only 8 gb of RAM. As such I am actually pretty happy with how the scene is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see my materials and call-out sheet for my models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First row: paper, gold, porcelain, bamboo. Second row is my landscape blending materials plus a weird looking hay I used for the &amp;ldquo;hanging rope&amp;rdquo; detail piece you can see in the second picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First row here is some basic wood materials I did in Substance. I then combined them in different ways, using Smart Masks in Painter. Last material is the stone I use in the scene. I made a simple one with exposed parameters for cracks and for hue. I then overlaid green version on top in order to make some cheap moss effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was lots of fun to do guys. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to bed all night. I mean, its morning here in the UK right now, but when I woke up around 20 hours ago, to begin work on this, I knew it was going to be my final day on it. It made me feel kind of weird, melancholic. It&amp;rsquo;s stupid, I know, but lots of you are so amazingly good at what you do, my only chance to catch up was to work crazy hours. And in those crazy hours, I got so used to this project, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m gonna feel empty for a quite a while, given that I will not wake up to have a stroll in it first thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all of you out there for the kind comments and words I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten along the way here. Also, great thanks to all of my relatives, and friends, who put up with me, talking about this project, every. single. day&amp;hellip; Got quite a lot of support over at my university too, so thank you guys over there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to mention my friend &lt;strong&gt;Rika Kanaya&lt;/strong&gt; again. She is the one behind the translations of my weird ideas from English to Japanese. She guided me through on how to put it in texts. Thank you Rika!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed my project, and I hope that the video and story gave you at least a bit of a kick-out. I think I will have a long break now. Maybe spend a week or two, just in the realms of the 2D, with some casual painting. :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. As always, have a good one. May we meet again in another project, just as fun as this one (but maybe, a titbit less stressful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recollections-and-memories-update-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recollections and memories. Update from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As I am here porting this old blog log into my new, personal blog website, I wanted to spend a few lines and talk about things I remember and recollect from this project. From the time I wrote the above at 4-5 am, in that sunless, British morning in my student accommodation flat over in Preston where I studied Game Design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above I talk about melancholy. I very much to this day remember the feeling and could go on to describe it in detail even now, 5 years later. Indeed, the daily opening and navigation of the scene branded into my mind strongly the space. For the following months, even a year and a bit after I finished this scene I remember having occasional moments of closing my eyes and in front of me, in my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye, seeing the Japanese scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was happening and was incredibly strong the few days after I finished the project so I occasionally had moments of pondering if this project will indeed be engrained into my DNA for the rest of my life and if I will be revisiting it in my nightly dreams all the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a few more scenes and I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of them have come as close as to this one as being entangled into my mind and my psyche. That is even through the fact that most of my scenes after this one, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more hours on and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and done much better job at detail, space, texture, color and composition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There might be only one space so engrained into my mind, now that I think of it. That would perhaps be my section of the Sniper Elite 5 multiplayer map &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flooded Village&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; that I worked on over at &lt;em&gt;Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;. If in the scene above I spent two and a bit months of opening it and navigating its space daily, then Flooded Village I have spend 3-4 times that. As such I got the same &amp;ldquo;Tetris effect&amp;rdquo; where on some days my mind wonders off and I go into a daydream. In that daydream I find myself into the space and zones of Flooded Village.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tech talk though&amp;ndash;things I got wrong above, in the initial post in 2018. I talk about pushing my visuals to the very max and as such my performance suffering when I am overlooking the entire Japanese scene. Well, yes, I did give it my max but back then my max was not that demanding on resources as detail in textures, and geometry, is relatively lacking. That is if you compare it to my current works. As such there was another missing piece of the puzzle. The piece dragging my performance down. That is &lt;strong&gt;draw calls&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though the lanterns you see above lack animations at the end, I did leave them as Movable Blueprints, as such splitting each lantern into its own, individual draw call. The little tiles that make up the paths, I scaled on the x;y;z in all kinds of fractions, splitting each and one of them into individual draw call as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not run any profiling to see my draw calls in that scene (I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about it back in 2018). And I hardly have the time to go back into that project now and check, but I can guarantee you that indeed the draw calls are needlessly high.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such whenever you work on your projects, pay attention to them. If you wish, you can read more about draw calls over&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(if you somehow missed the blog in the first place).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find the gallery for &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo; with all of its screenshots and videos over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/aRoa1k&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with its problems this project still has a special place in my heart. Over time, in the last few years, I also realized that this is one of my most popular projects (most likely due to me writing about its process over at 80 lv website. Also being featured in The Rookies and getting printed in 3D Magazine thanks to a rubric about The Rookies.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its making I think I&amp;rsquo;ve grown a lot and learned tons more about art, 3D, composition and crafting good spaces. Yet I try to embrace this project, knowing how much it&amp;rsquo;s enjoyed by most of the lovely people that follow my art online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such thank you very much for reading through the blogs about the making of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for all of the nice words, to those of you who have reached out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the best,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My, my, I have a mountain in. It&amp;rsquo;s not like it was not a vital prop, and its not like there are just 2 days to go&amp;hellip; Priorities, right? It was super fun to do. I booted up &lt;em&gt;World Machine&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, and at the start wasn&amp;rsquo;t certain what I am getting into, but its node based design, just like &lt;em&gt;Substance&lt;/em&gt;, helped me navigate and get my bearing relatively easy. Exported high-poly from there, and took it to &lt;em&gt;Zbrush&lt;/em&gt; for decimation and then &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt; for baking and some color passes using the curvature and thickness.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me that the screenshot from &lt;em&gt;Painter&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the mountain look like ice cream&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only consideration now, is that I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure how the trees in the distance fit in the scene. I tried to change them, I have better prop for them, but my FPS goes down crazily, even after quite a bit of optimisation. I prefer to keep those jaggedly trees, and be able to record a nice video with good FPS. I don&amp;rsquo;t want it for the fly-through of it, the scene is quite limited to viewing angles anyways, but I really want it for the telling of a story through it. One I&amp;rsquo;ve had in mind for ages now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shrine&#34;&gt;Shrine&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really needed that tiger statue in order to record the kind of video I want. I wanted to give it a more dynamic pose and so put it as if its ready to slap someone. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to detail it, but it will do. Before moving it to that pose, I exported it sitting straight too though, in order to use that for the shrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is the last post, and next one is the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, thanks for reading, have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started photo-bashing my own sky. Finally got into SpeedTree, and using the leaves that I created ages ago, plus a new bamboo texture, I produced a better looking result. My tree in the distance still needs replacing though. The mountains too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-017/48_shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I toned down nearly every light in the scene. Especially the bamboo candles (which still need texturing, so sad&amp;hellip;). Also increased the area of lots of them, trying to achieve more clarity and go away from the small clusters of bright lights, that would be more appropriate for modern skyline, than a feudal village in the middle of the woods&amp;hellip; Could they do with more work? Sure, but we will see what can be done with the tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had a better opportunity to create spherical paper lanterns than this anytime soon. So that is what I did, an orange and a yellow version. I feel like they improved the mood and atmosphere quite a bit. They also made some of the random spotlights I had scattered around, feel like they actually have a source now.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empty space in the Calligraphers, I filled a bit more, trying to tell a story of some sorts. It&amp;rsquo;s hard though, as I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to produce more props.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cushions are looking kind of shy, but we will see if I have any free time to work on them more. Before that, I feel like the floor material and walls need my attention first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any comments are much appreciated. As always, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally worked on those scrolls! I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying I will for what, maybe like 3-4 posts? Quite happy with how they turned out. I was worried that given that I fitted 25 of them in one texture set, there wont be enough texel density, and I wont be able to make them look proper. No matter if the texture were 1k or 2k. But they actually work quite well, even from up close.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started them by making a paper and a sort of &amp;ldquo;gold leaf&amp;rdquo; materials in Designer. Got them in Painter, and then the first one I did, is actually the one with the branches detail. I went in Photoshop beforehand, and hand painted an alpha for it. I was quite happy to draw and paint once again, given that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to do so since I&amp;rsquo;ve started this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly realised, though, that I don&amp;rsquo;t really need alphas drawn in Photoshop, as I can draw just as good straight into Painter with the gold itself. I think this was the most fun thing I&amp;rsquo;ve done for the project so far. That vase is also hand-painted. So I hope you like it&amp;hellip; No pressure&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;hand-painted&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m kidding, its not that impressive once you turn the symmetry on. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furniture texture is looking kind of rough here and there, but I will have to keep it like this if I want to actually accomplish everything I&amp;rsquo;ve planned. Also the textures on the walls call for a bit more attention as well, but we shall see about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Any comments are appreciated. Have a good night from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress 13 &lt;em&gt;(narrator from 2023: this was not his 13th post. He just could not count right back then)&lt;/em&gt;, what a fitting number. I just realised I have deleted one of my Zbrush sculpts&amp;hellip; I am nearly certain I won&amp;rsquo;t need it again, and even if I do, I can start off right from the decimated, exported version of it, but still, made me wonder where the heck I am looking when deleting files&amp;hellip; I blame Photoshop though, as it refused to launch and demanded for more &amp;ldquo;scratch disk space&amp;rdquo; and thus sent me into a chaotic &lt;em&gt;(and apparently unsuccessful)&lt;/em&gt; process of trying to tidy up my vast collection of rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I sculpted and textured the stones the big shrine goes onto and also worked on the shrine itself too. My first version of the stone texture had lots of bricks and extrusions on it. It was too detailed and noisy though, so I stepped back to the ordinary stone material. I still plan on scattering a few more small statues on top, and adding more candles too, so it surely wont be left without enough detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweaked the lights in the calligraphers and actually created a proper light source prop for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;props&#34;&gt;Props&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textured the tsukue (desk) and put an ink holder on top together with some ink blobs on the desk itself. I&amp;rsquo;m going to create a few pens and brushes that go on special stands, and one of them will be rolled and have spilled its ink, as if someone left in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve planned on quite a few more props to fill the empty space. Lets hope I manage to create them relatively quickly in the next day or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and as usually - those scrolls still need texturing&amp;hellip; I should get to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly finished texturing the whole exterior of the calligraphers workshop. Texturing this was a self-exploration in the sense of realising that I am incredibly picky when it comes to wood textures&amp;hellip; The result you see is a combination of 2-3 materials I made in Designer, combined with Smart Masks in Painter after a bake of high-poly sculpted quickly in Zbrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll show you the materials properly rendered in Designer, but that will be later, as I am a bit too lazy to go back once again to those dreadful graphs (dreadful in the sense of I, going back to them multiple times, after realising that I&amp;rsquo;ve forgot to expose a specific value, exporting them multiple times, and relying to naming conventions similar but just as plainly unimaginative as &lt;em&gt;wooden01, wooden02, wood03_final, wood03_final01, wood_final_final&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I tried to have some color variety in the wood itself, I knew that I will need to break it up with some ornaments. Also I really wanted to have something metallic in my scene. Every cool kid seems to have one texture set with just alphas for ornaments so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t skip on making one myself. I did that by baking in Designer some high-poly shapes I made in Maya and Zbrush. Using the Normal and Curvature together with deploying a vast number of Levels Nodes to get some specific edges, I build up some color and roughness variation in the gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about that pipeline is the fact that I can go back to my bake set-up, quickly add some more shapes, and after I do a new bake in Designer, the newly created shapes will instantly have the golden look without me having to do any more work. Also right now my texture set is 60-70% empty, so I have plenty of space to create some more interesting shapes and motives, instead of just the circles and the other one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I&amp;rsquo;ve illuminated the front of that building is very theatrical and dramatic. Although I really, really like it, I will most certainly tweak it later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is to model out some more furniture in there and also finally put some proper paper textures and roughness on those scrolls and posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, thanks for reading. Have a good one from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the most of the time these last few days working on vegetation. I created a tree to scatter in the distance, some grass and a flower. The tree really makes me think that I should probably try SpeedTree, as what I produced cannot even begin to compare to what everyone else uses in their scenes thanks to the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, thanks god the tree is so far away, because let me tell you, for now it does not look impressive at all.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am somehow more happy with how the grass and flowers turned out though. I managed to model them and then bake and place some rough base color and roughness. I will have to go back and give them a bit more noise and detail later on.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve put more work on my landscape materials too, creating more detail. They could use with a bit more though, so I will keep working on that too in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progression&#34;&gt;Gif progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a GIF:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time I mentioned that I kind of struggled making the bricks path, and here you can see it in action. Also now you can agree/disagree with whether what I settled down with is the best from everything I tried with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 15 more days but if I don&amp;rsquo;t hurry up with all of the furniture and texturing for the calligraphers hut, I might not make it&amp;hellip; So next, I will try to focus on that. The foliage can have a revisit by the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how a few posts ago, I said I am quite happy to have a working Landscape Blending material? Well I was sort of wrong back then, as my tessellation wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. I knew that, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t as much matter back then as I had no height information. Well, the other day, when I created that height, it put me in quite the stressful situation of spending the whole day trying to figure out how to finish the blending of the height itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-012/29_shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got it working, then spend tiny bit of time on a grassy-mossy looking material and one that&amp;rsquo;s kind of rocky. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to post renders of them now, as they are far away from finished. Still, its nice to have some roughness information on the landscape. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have more grassy bits, but I will do that when I have proper foliage/flowers to put on top, because without that it will just look silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brick path leading to the staircase that you can see, I redid about two or three times. First time it was too perfect. Then it was too chaotic and broken, with pieces everywhere. I tried elevating the whole thing. Then I tried having it go a bit inside the landscape. At the end I settled down on what you see now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, your eyes are not deceiving you—I finally have that calligraphers hut interior and some scrolls! (not finished and texture, but a progress nonetheless).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some thought into the text. As such I want to thank my good friend &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rika Kanaya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for helping me with the translation to Japanese. Lots of the texts are just wishes for good fortune. Just like what my research led me believe is the common practice. But then we have a few sentences that lead to some story about the place. It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be a flavour text, so you wont be missing much if you, like me, can&amp;rsquo;t read Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few scrolls call the shrine an &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Then some, like the very long one in the very middle of the picture above, explain that, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;hellip;this Shrine is a place for those who want to command the animals as their soldiers.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Among others are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spirits inhabit this place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The statues shall come to life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Point at your enemies and the animals will follow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I made those so they lead to a story that I came up with the other week. The story is that you could leave gifts at the shrine and get involved in some kind of summoning ritual, where you can send thousands of critters after an enemy of yours. The animals would do your bidding. Its quite the fantasy spin, but that is what I like the most - fantasy works. I am hoping to be able to showcase that idea through my final video using some cheap effects, but honestly, I might not have the time to get that far.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally blocked out the calligraphers hut properly. It&amp;rsquo;s actually more than just a greybox, as I split the hut properly into finalised modular pieces, UV mapped most of them and even turned the front one that&amp;rsquo;s kind of dramatically lit in the picture, into a high-poly. It&amp;rsquo;s all ready for some arduous hand-sculpting in Zbrush before baking and texturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I made a rabbit sculpture. Today I made two frogs. I have this idea that the shrine could be one for offerings towards animals like rabbits, frogs, turtles, cranes, foxes and so on. All of them are seen in specific ways in Japanese culture, and I could have references to that in the calligraphers hut with the scrolls on the walls. I mean, those are common animals, they have their role in every single culture, but still I thought it could be an interesting and nice way to fill in the empty space of the environment. Also its an opportunity for me to have a go at making my own sculpts and seeing what I can produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a grand idea about all of them tying up together in a specific way, to be seen in my final video fly-through, but we will see if I have the time to do it, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go into explaining it this early.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;302px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I finally sculpted and textured the staircase, the Komainu and the modular fence pieces. I am quite happy with the dog and the stairs, but those wood textures of the fencing could probably do with some more work.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;294px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the modular pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-011/25_shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;402px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll make some golden ornaments to break up the places in the wood where its too uniform (I mean, look at that corner piece&amp;hellip;), but I am more worried for the wood texture itself. I tried quite a few ones I made in Designer, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like any of them. I will have to try again I presume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progression&#34;&gt;Gif progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted any GIFs in ages, lets have one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-011/06-japan-peter-dimitrov.gif&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can notice the change in the calligraphers hut here easier. Something else too - I completely changed the source of the light in the scene. It was coming from the left, but I rotated it to go directly from the right (as seen from this camera angle). It put the right-hand side into a dramatic shadow, giving much more dynamic feel to the whole scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about the light-source also makes me think how I will need to work on the skybox at some point. It&amp;rsquo;s not seen much from this angle, but in my other main camera shot, we can see the sky quite a bit more. And then that reminds me that I need actual mountains and trees (or bamboo) in the distance. And all of that reminds me of even more unfinished stuff, but lets stop this rabbit-hole here. Ahhhh! Maybe I should have some rabbit holes too? Would be mysterious, right? Nah, I&amp;rsquo;m just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Have a good night from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finalized modelling and texturing 2 modular pieces and a prop. I also did some work on the landscape actor. The textures on the land are a placeholder and the colors maybe a bit too red, but I am really happy with how my Landscape Blending Material works. Created it in a such a way that its very easy to include a new texture and also parameters for roughness and tiling amount are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the modular bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-010/22_shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;428px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go a bit heavier on geometry, because my main shots include those pieces repeated so much that they take quite a bit of screen space. Instead of tileable texture, I sculpted the two pieces, baked and then used my stone material I showed a few posts ago. Exposing HSV of it proved very useful as I was able to give it this green look that way. I might make the surface of the stones more light so they appear a bit more grey later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meme&#34;&gt;Meme&lt;/h2&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve actually never seen the movie but came across the meme randomly.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meme to illustrate my thoughts (image not mine, its a meme after all). In an ideal world for an ideal game, I would have to do lots of optimizing with a few LODs for that modular prop. But as its not gonna get repeated that much and as we are dealing with specific angle shots, I can save time and not do it. That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason I decided to go with geometry instead of Substance Designer made texture, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you like what you see, feel free to drop a comment. Good night from me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023-polycount&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023 (polycount)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back when I was making these stone, inclined beds above, I distinctively remember being incredibly worried that what I am creating is crazy amounts of high-poly. That whoever sees my work will see right past me and understand how inexperienced I am because of the high triangle count.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could have not been further from the truth (even with that second part above, about being inexperienced, being true back then).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t quote you exact numbers but if memory serves me well, the stones wall prop was sitting around 1,800 - 2,000 tris.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is absolutely acceptable. It is acceptable as a prop tris count now in 2023 and it was back in 2018 too. Not much has changed in the span of those years (well, if we ignore Nanite and the possibilities of UE5 right now, of course&amp;hellip;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the topic opens up a perfect opportunity to talk about triangle counts and preconceptions (and misconceptions) that fly around in students heads (like mine back then!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will try to keep it short and to the point, so my advise now would be: do not take polycount advise from people who don&amp;rsquo;t know what draw calls or LODs are. Do not take polycount advise from people who will not ask the questions of what the intended game style is and what the main gameplay camera implementation is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth is you can get away with really high poly budgets for a single object. You can do that because you can then implement a few LODs that load much smaller polycount copies with the player going further away from the object.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a lot of student projects not only are there no LODs in sight, especially in projects that are FPS and would benefit immensely from it, but in most of them the draw calls are an absolute mess as well.
As such the performance of their game prototype is dragged down by mostly that: over the roof high amount of draw calls and crazy amount of overlapping dynamic lights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next when inevitably the question pops up, in their prototype, of &amp;ldquo;What is wrong with the performance?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How do we regain back good performance?&amp;rdquo; lots and lots of inexperienced tutors will take a look at the screen and in a deep, pondering facial expression go: &amp;ldquo;Hmmmm, yes&amp;hellip; your props are way too highpoly and the amount of tris drawn on the screen are too high.&amp;rdquo;. Wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analyze your draw calls first, look at your lights, consider some LODs and only then go cutting big percentages of polycount from objects that are most likely already lowpoly and optimized enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Unreal you can open the CMD (using the ¬ key on your keyboard) and type &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo;. A menu will pop up that lists your amount of draw calls. Consider looking into ways to reduce them if they are high.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another very useful command is &amp;ldquo;ProfileGPU&amp;rdquo; that will open you up a much more detailed screen where you can see a breakdown of how much resources go where in ms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading all of those is crucial for understanding better what the culprit of your performance is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to read more about draw calls (though not a technical guide by any means) you can do so over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;

        <title>The Animal Shrine - 09 - Revamp on Layout</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/18-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Animal Shrine - 09 - Revamp on Layout" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;revamp-back-to-basics&#34;&gt;Revamp. Back to basics.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/18-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that painting and illustration has taught me better than any anything else, it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that sometimes you can feel in your gut that there is a problem in your composition, but you cloud your mind and decide to ignore it because of fear of failing in trying to fix it. The truth in nearly 10 out of 10 cases, though, is that if you put the time in and you do not ignore it, there is no chance you will not succeed in improving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this environment, I could feel the square, too perfect shape. I thought that it fits nicely a shrine, or a temple like that. According to my research, in Japan they did build them in that fashion quite frequently. But that does not change the fact, that no matter what angle I would take with my camera, most of the shots were way too flat and kind of boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went in and used to my advantage the modularity of my props. I left the two main buildings elevated, but took the square hut and shrine down one level. I did that in hopes of capturing more dynamic shots with more interesting silhouettes and better shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/19-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;187&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;450px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like it did improve quite a bit, and although I will still be posting shots capturing the whole place, I am going to stick to some specific angles and work on what is seen in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textures you see for the landscape are placeholders (kind of obvious when you take a look at those roughness channel values).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/20_HighresScreenshot00168.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;187&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my very first post I mentioned that I have a special idea for the square hut. I finally went in and blocked it. I want it to look like the workshop of a master calligrapher. All around on the walls and the entrance are hanging countless of scrolls with all sorts of fortunes written in beautiful calligraphy. It needs lots of work but I will try to keep it relatively simple and give it more detail with the scrolls. A good friend of mine from Japan will help me put some proper sentences and texts on those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/21_HighresScreenshot00168.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;187&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed some tiny lamps on the shrine, but the idea is that they will be candles put in bamboo sticks cut at a sharp angle. I blocked out a few shapes in front of it. One will be a trough and the ones next to it will be vases, plants and some statues at the very front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;rsquo;t had a GIF for a while so here is one as usual. Starting from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-009/03-japan-peter-dimitrov02.gif&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you do agree that there is an improvement. I want to thank a few friends that gave me the valuable feedback of saying that the place was looking a bit too flat, even though I had it elevated and every single building was on a different construction level as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few important props still missing, but I will get right to modelling those and then I will try to focus on getting finalized textures and models. I created a cobblestone material, which I still haven&amp;rsquo;t implemented in the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;411px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t much created anything finished these last days. It has been more a process of exploration and learning of lots of things I had to go through. I started sculpting a Foo Dog, or what they call in Japan, a Komainu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-008/17-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;252px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of it, in my opinion at least, is that statues like those which are actually old, fall in a weird, soft &amp;ldquo;uncanny valley&amp;rdquo; territory. Sculptors that made them obviously did the best they could for their time. Do you know whose else&amp;rsquo;s work falls in a category like that? Well, mine does. See, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience sculpting. But because I am making something &amp;ldquo;ancient&amp;rdquo;, I can get away with having weird proportions here and there. Although I did try to keep most of it appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor guy is still missing detail on his paws, but I&amp;rsquo;ll spend some time on that before I bake him. His backside also looks a bit like a squirrel, but its an improvement from the look of a incapacitated rabbit that he had at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might leave him looking a bit weird like that, because I can get away with it as of the aforementioned reasons. It might even add that extra charm and mystique to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the lesser of my problems though. I started doing textures for the ground, and sadly I still don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to show although I did quite a bit of work. I did realize a lot of stuff though, and it keeps me positive that when I continue with it in the next days, I should have some successful materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a quick ordinary stone texture. Something to add to my library as I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use any of the Painter defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also exposed all of the values - hue, saturation and value + some parameters for how much and deep the cracks are. Should be quite useful and a lot of models that call for stone materials are waiting for me anyway. I will do a moss now and mix the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another model. A detail, as I badly need those at this point, my scene is quite empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those big twisty bits and the things underneath them that look like bells right now, are made out of hay. Everything is tied together with ropes and looks quite immense and amazing to be fair. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass on having something like that. Gonna bake it on a lower poly model and do the hay in Substance Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show you the reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a final thought, today I started some foliage. I am doing a bamboo-like plant. I keep calling it bamboo, but it really isn&amp;rsquo;t. Its supposed to have thinner branch and lots of leaves that are more circular and spread out. Doing that in Maya, the leaves in Zbrush and then all baked and textured in Substance Designer (Thanks a lot to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/kazperstan&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think about it guys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for those of you who who made it through this long and boring blog post, and are reading this, I have a question. This foliage left me puzzled, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t really done any before&amp;hellip; Could you tell me how you do yours, guys? How do you put it in the engine and what options look the best? See, at the end, I left the mesh (imported and used as foliage with the foliage brush) to be dynamic. Leaving it to static, and baking lightmaps, at no matter what resolutions, produced a cluster of black rigged edges. No matter the size. Feels like increasing the resolution of the lightmap even makes it worse (does not make any sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene is quite empty yet, I haven&amp;rsquo;t placed many pieces of foliage at all, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been really smart with my lightmaps resolutions so far. Not being able to bake this as static makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot. Any comments are much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally replaced those cylinders I had at the very front that were supposed to be shrines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were still some crucial bits that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have even in greybox. Mainly because I was pretty confident that I know how I want them and it wont take that much to do them. Was I right? Well it took me 3-4 different iterations of doing the same balcony before I settled down on what I like, so maybe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t right after all. But I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what - it felt refreshing and nice to do it after falling in the hole of &amp;ldquo;oh is this texture worth anything&amp;rdquo; yesterday and the day before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-007/15-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;467px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Props are still placeholders and some lack textures. Then there is the very long roof which is 3 shrunk huge roofs and thus the baked AO that has left marks as if from burnt. The bits that are not textured though I even UV mapped so it should be relatively quick to give them the wooden look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the texture of the roof that you see on the big one. First version was very grey and dark, then I went into more of a brown warm wood look which helped a lot. The bits on the very top are gonna be metal and have oxidized green parts (bronze) that I hope will contrast nicely with the wood. Still I feel like it lacks a bit of variation and texture and as such I will go over the edges and add metal ornaments/rain plates and so on, that will hopefully break up the wood and make it more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an ordinary wood planks texture I did in Substance Designer to go on the walls:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I though it was very boring and dull and is gonna look bad in Unreal. Turns out that wooden walls are very much ordinary, and maybe its for the best not to have anything crazy going on. I think i will leave it like that for now, see how it works with the metal and with the rest of the textures in the scene, and then maybe come back to it and add detail, make it actually realistic or completely change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GIFs remind me of one last thought that I have about my scene development. Most of the angles I show in the GIFs have the thinking of &amp;ldquo;what would be the best angle to fit everything in the picture and show my progression in the most transparent way&amp;rdquo;. Thus the far-away aerial shots from some of the previous posts. What I really should do soon though, is pick some specific angles that look good and make the scene justice. Then I will have to stick to those and make sure they above all look the best so I can use them as final images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind my whole level and development here is that I want the scene to have a &amp;ldquo;game ready&amp;rdquo; look, where if you throw the player in, no matter First or 3rd Person, they can traverse anywhere and everything will look perfect from any angle. Will that work though? I might have to accept the fact that I might not be able to do that for the short deadline we have. Not with the quality that I want anyway. And if that is the case, then I need to have proper angles and bits where I can fall back to and know that they will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though, I&amp;rsquo;m sticking to the &amp;ldquo;game ready&amp;rdquo; mentality, no matter the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, comments are much appreciated and have a good night from me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Animal Shrine - 06 - Lamps</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/12-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Animal Shrine - 06 - Lamps" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lights-in&#34;&gt;Lights In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I modelled some hanging lanterns. I really needed to put some object that cast actual interesting light in my scene so I can start thinking about my light scenario. It&amp;rsquo;s still in the early stages and looks patchy in the sense of having a lot at of light at one place and then none at others, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/12-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I sculpted a bit more the landscape around the place. I also scattered a lot of placeholders for the trees. It changed the mood of the whole place immediately in a way that I really like. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to look into how I&amp;rsquo;m going to make the trees and what to do with my mountains in the distance (they are just placeholder big boulders for now). I&amp;rsquo;m open to any suggestions and tips when it comes to creating the landscape guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the lanterns, they were kind of very fun to do. Their process was interesting to say the least. Right now they are an Actor (Blueprint) attached with a rope and a Physics Constraint. That way I can apply physics to them and use Impulse to add force and nudge them in one direction. Gives them a slight animation and it makes such a big difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While making them, I had to explore how the Physics Blueprints work in Unreal as I had never used them before. It produced an interesting result. Just when I thought that none of the Blueprints worked even the slightest, I looked up and saw a few lanterns suspended in the air, rotating around as if in zero G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOTc2GFSAnU&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have them working now, and its something that I believe will add quite a bit to my scene when it comes to the final rendering videos. Also now I know how to do stuff like that for any other object I might want to implement that could be moving. Only thing left now is to actually texture those lanterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;as-in-my-every-post-its-time-for-a-gif-now&#34;&gt;As in my every post, its time for a GIF now&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to change the fog once again in order to make the &amp;ldquo;trees&amp;rdquo; in the distance appear lighter and thus look even further away. The fog changed how my roofs look though, made them maybe too light for my liking. The Volumetric Fog and Atmosphere actors are things I will have to tweak a lot more before I get to what I imagine, but at least there is progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be from me tonight guys, have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023-draw-calls-tips&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023 (draw calls tips)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly drop a few words about some of the things I showcase above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing what I know now, in 2023, compared to back in 2018, I would not approach making these lanterns with Physics Components at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is fun to experiment with Physics Components in Blueprints. If you have not had the chance to do so before, make sure to try as I think there is plenty to learn. There is something I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about back then though, and it&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental part of Tech Art and of creating optimized, real time scenes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is draw calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Physics to work, we need to make the lanterns mesh &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;. The moment we do that, we separate that piece of geometry in its own draw call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lets run a hypothetical situation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We leave the lantern static - like ordinary geometry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We scatter 10 copies of it near one another.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then we make sure the material used on all 10 copies is identical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the scaling options of each we leave it to 1;1;1 on the x;y;z scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great thing happens; the moment those 10 lanterns get to render on the screen they batch into a single draw call. This keeps it all more optimized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we are in a blank scene and we render 10 lanterns in 1 draw call as opposed to 10 lanterns in 10 draw calls, we might not feel much of a difference, even if we inspect the fps / ms and profile the entire scene both GPU and CPU wise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine increasing up the numbers and putting 100-200 even 1000 of these lanterns on the screen. Suddenly rendering all in 1 draw call as opposed to 1000 draw calls can be felt. Then add up all kinds of other art assets on the screen, some static, some movable. Add a bunch of fog cards and alpha card effects that are overdrawing the screen. Add lots of AI running on the CPU. Add some particles, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you pick to scale them onto the CPU or the GPU. Suddenly you get the typical amount of things happening in a usual game world in a big AAA title.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your performance will then be low, if you were to render these lanterns in 1000 draw calls instead of 1 draw call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lesson here being that we always need to consider clean practices of putting in art meshes so they end up as optimized and bundle in draw calls as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can hear you wondering, though, how are we to then make these lanterns move and look interesting? Without dirtying up our draw calls?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some might suggest doing a bespoke bone animation and then attaching it to the lantern. We animate it in Blender or Maya and import in Unreal. But that will have the same culprit of an issue as above. Animated assets with bones of their own most of the time end up as separate draw calls (there are ways to overcome that and still keep bone animations but that is for another blog).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such a better way instead would be to ask the following. Is there a way I can bundle all of this movement onto the GPU? When you ask that question the follow up conclusion would be: yes! You can. Through a material shader perhaps? That&amp;rsquo;s on the GPU, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Absolutely. If we create this entire animation of moving the lantern in some direction, as if slightly moved by wind, inside the shader, then it means the geometry when placed in the world can remain Static. When it remains static it means our draw calls are back to being easier to manage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My suggestion for getting that done would be to 0.0.0 your pivot point of the mesh to where the upper cable of the lantern is. Export like that and put into Unreal. In a special material shader for the lantern then, create a World Position Offset (WPO) that slightly rotates everything in whichever axis you like. If you add a little Sine animation multiplier to that, inside the WPO numbers, you will get exactly a bit of movement as if pushed by the wind. Apply that to all other lanterns now and they will all bundle into draw calls, as long as using the same material and their scale in the world is similar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you dislike the lantern movement being similar between all of them, you could introduce a bit of a random number multiplier in the shader to overcome it. Or you could expose a number that controls it, and in a material instance of the original parent put in your own animation offset as a number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you do that second option though, consider making just 3-4 material instances and then applying them to your 300-400 lanterns in the scene so they all end up in 3-4 draw calls. If you go out of your way to make a unique instance for each lantern then we are back to square one and we end up with all of them having a unique draw call (kind of bad).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know I quickly gloss over the last few tips, but I intend to give you the names of the techniques and resources you could look up online and I believe you can accomplish whatever it is you imagine using that. The tricky part is knowing, and being aware of it all in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is the part I struggled with the most before I joined the industry professionally. At my university for 3 years course not once were the words &amp;ldquo;draw calls&amp;rdquo; mentioned. When people talked about optimization everyone jumped to &amp;ldquo;oh well, its just too highpoly&amp;rdquo;. Though even back then I knew that clearly is not the case, it still took me years before I first realized about draw calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quite honestly, being in the industry now, I will tell you that even some professionals go for years unaware about draw calls. They talk and talk about lowpoly and highpoly but never consider their draw calls or implementing LODs to increase performance. But this would be a conversation for another time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for now, if you are a student or someone getting into things just now, and in this blog you for the first time came across the concept of draw calls, then I take it this was helpful and the idea of it leaves me happy. Now go on and look up some more engine docs and videos on draw calls and supplement and increase your knowledge even more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I started texturing. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planing on starting this soon, but I wanted to have a preview of what is to be. I also knew that I will go for a pipeline that I haven&amp;rsquo;t mastered before, so I wanted to make sure I can do it properly. I started with objects I have the exact dimensions of. That is the wooden supports that go around the place to create the &amp;ldquo;scaffolding&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that I wanted a wooden texture, but to be fair I imagined I will need to do a detailed pass of Substance Designer and then use that in Painter to layer out more finished non-tillable texture feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got the object in Zbrush, did a high-poly detailed sculpt of it and then baked it on low poly. I then layered a few colors together using the Curvature mask that Substance Painter bakes. The result is what you see, and to be honest I am pretty happy with it. If I manage to give everything else the same level of detail, I reckon it should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the image above, I modelled the basic shapes of the house a bit more. It got me, to what looks like in Maya, a Hansel and Gretel House. Note, I&amp;rsquo;ve marked with reddish color, shapes that don&amp;rsquo;t matter. What is white, is the shapes I need to bake and texture and then repeat to get the rest (the roof of course will be a piece of its own, with and UV of its own).&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;385px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with modular pieces quite a bit (as seen in the wooden supports). I realized that I can do much more with less models than I imagined at first. After I learned my lesson with the wooden supports, I made sure to make the most out of the shapes I create with the house models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;as-always-lets-do-a-gif-my-favorite&#34;&gt;As always, lets do a GIF! My favorite.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-005/01-japan-peter-dimitrov02.gif&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, I haven&amp;rsquo;t put much work into the lighting scenario. I am really happy with the modular pieces though, because they are really low poly and I managed to get the most out of them by baking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see them laid out here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-005/HighresScreenshot00075.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;158&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;380px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did is two big pieces (a part from the very small one) I modelled those those out - sculpted them in high detail - and then baked. Then I cut the pieces in the very middle. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do any changes on the UV or textures. I managed to get 2 extra pieces out of one sculpt. And that did make quite the big difference. Using those, I could manage to recreated and replace all of the basic brushes in Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else - quite obvious but still - a cube (or parallelepiped) has 4 sides. If you sculpt and bake those properly, you can rotate the same object each time you repeat it and get enough variation out of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna texture the new pieces I did for the main buildings soon (the emissive windows and etc.) and I hope it looks good. I&amp;rsquo;ll share all of the results with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good night from me, and I hope you are doing great!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Animal Shrine - 04 - Fences</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-004/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-004/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-004/08-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Animal Shrine - 04 - Fences" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-from-today-and-yesterday&#34;&gt;Work from today and yesterday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general I&amp;rsquo;ve been going around and replacing Unreal basic brushes with proper models. Takes a bit more time, as I try to model them in a way that they are ready to jump in for high-poly and Zbrush before baking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been mastering my technique of making smooth roofs by now. I did one 3 times, wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy at all with the result and then came up with better idea of how to do it just when I was drowsing off having a rest in my bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am most happy about, though, is my modular pieces for the fencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-004/08-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 pieces in total. One that repeats to create the main fencing, one corner and on edge bit that I use at the very front gate. I&amp;rsquo;m really happy how they fit together and that there are no weird lines and shadows where the pieces meet (only weird lines right now are from the quick placeholder UVs that distort the texture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also increased the fog a bit, which will interfere with my perfect aerial shot GIFs, making it harder to see, but oh well. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a square gazebo of sorts (not sure what the proper name is) that I&amp;rsquo;ve placed at the very entrance of each big building. I also made some lamps that at first looked like Old London light posts&amp;hellip; They are a bit better now but still really need a texture to convey at best what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a Shrine now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress-view&#34;&gt;Gif progress view&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, its time for my favourite part, a GIF! Lets have one that starts from the very beginning and gets to the current state:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Animal Shrine - 03 - Roof</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/03-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Animal Shrine - 03 - Roof" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;roofing&#34;&gt;Roofing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of the hours I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the project today on the roofs of the buildings. I started doing that in Maya, modelling them in such a way that they are good enough to be turned into high-poly, then baked and textured. I&amp;rsquo;ll add more detail on them before I do that of course, but its nice to finally see them in and realise what silhouettes the buildings create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/03-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is a GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/02-japan-peter-dimitrov02.gif&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are really smooth and lack any tiling mainly because I imagine them to be from wood. The reference I am looking at in this case, is the Izumo Taisha Shrine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/07-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;129&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;310px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll replicate the texture in Substance Designer later on use it on the roofing. My only consideration is that they might be left looking a bit bare and not finished at the end. I think it has to do with the fact that, when we talk about Japanese or Chinese buildings of this style, we always imagine one covered in numerous pretty, circular tiles. As such by the end I might collide a few different styles and end up with something of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Animal Shrine - 02 - Blockout</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-002/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-002/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-002/01-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Animal Shrine - 02 - Blockout" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;greyboxing&#34;&gt;Greyboxing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been greyboxing the concept for my level for a few hours now. I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited how its shaping already and wanted to update all of you with some screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I did a sketch on paper looking at the level top-down. In that one, I made every single shape and the buildings square. Today, playing with the shapes in Unreal, I decided that I want to break up the level a bit more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-002/01-shot-peter-dimitrov-japan.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be sure that there is variety in height too, and as such I elevated the whole place. I created wooden structures for each building to sit on. I still don&amp;rsquo;t have the roofs, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think its much worth it to even greybox them in Unreal. Making them to look like anything, even for illustrative purposes, will take far too long, and now that I have figured most of the measurements I can just dive into Maya and make them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fencing around the whole place will be from stone. It will also have its own mini triangular roofing that is probably gonna be wooden (in the style of the rest of the buildings). For the square building to the right I have an interesting idea, but I will share it with you given that everything else goes according to plan the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some progress GIFs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-002/01-japan-peter-dimitrov.gif&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun to see it get built like this in an animation, as if some invisible workers are putting it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An angular shot for a better view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-002/02-japan-peter-dimitrov.gif&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is an aerial shot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-002/03-japan-peter-dimitrov.gif&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-work&#34;&gt;Further work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m imagining prolific and bulky (but smooth) triangular roofs that go on 2 or even 3 levels. I think they will compliment the squarish shapes underneath and create some interesting silhouettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the whole place I want to scatter lots of trees, as to make this whole place in a remote, tranquil location. In one of the reference books that I got, the author put it so nicely in words, that its quite the inspiration for me &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the plains would have formed a veritable sea of trees, their tips stretching into the distance like waves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, given technical limitations on the number of trees I can have and also the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve never done a serious foliage before, let alone a tree, we shall see if I manage to accomplish view worthy of that description. But that is something for the very end, and as such not worth any worry right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you like what you see and that your projects are coming along nicely guys! Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to create a scene where the whole concept is mine. As such I decided not to use any art from the Environment Design category. I gathered some images and put them in one sheet in order to have the basic mood and ideas there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I&amp;rsquo;m not using any concept pieces, I was worried that I might struggle a bit. As such yesterday I visited my University&amp;rsquo;s library in order to do some research and get some books on the topic. I borrowed 3 books on the topic as you can see below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-001/peter-dimitrov-books_compress.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about the different buildings will help me immensely, as I feel like I need to know their purpose, not only their visual appearance. As you can see in the picture I&amp;rsquo;ve already went crazy with bookmarking quite a lot of pages. At some point it got so much, that I had to start even putting notes on the bookmarks to keep up with whats going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some sketches on paper and initial idea of the layout of my environment, but more to come possibly tonight. I&amp;rsquo;ll update you with some Unreal progress.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;A woman dressed in a white shirt and an oversized, metal shoulder pad on her left. The shoulder pads has sci-fi panels and textures. There are also circular elements with teal, sci-fi glow on them. The woman has a headset with a microphone. Her eyes are hologram-like teal color. Behind her is a planet. In all directions, facing away from the planet as a center point, lots of large spaceships fly away. They are on a voyage towards the stars.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a long while since the last time I posted a painting, but here is one I created after playing around with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://recklessdeck.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Reckless Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t ordinary do much Sci-Fi, but I have a hidden love for it, having grown up predominantly watching Sci-fi TV-shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the deck, I had the idea of this character being an AI that has an actual, physical headset, where her chip-sets are. She then projects light downwards through that headset, generating her whole body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did attempt to make her a hologram, but to be fair it did not add anything to the composition visually speaking. Just made it look more cluttered. As such I left her looking like a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More of her story? I will leave that to your fantasy. Maybe she is a hyper intelligent AI, guiding the human race (or her creators species) through the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VR University Assignment</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/uni-vr-2018/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/uni-vr-2018/Screenshot01-vr.jpg" alt="Featured image of post VR University Assignment" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;university-class-assignment&#34;&gt;University class assignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AcIHtA9jAd8&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short showcase of one of the projects I got to work together with two friends from University. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/cristalyn&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Christina Vangou&lt;/a&gt; and Charlie Critchley. Time was very limited on this project, and we had to create everything from scratch. No use of already made asset packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you see is a tiny corner of a much bigger space base. This corner is the one where we got to finish and fully texture and model out though, and as such I am showing this to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was Virtual Reality based, and although we did put quite a bit of time on a few different game mechanics and puzzles, we don’t have the resources right now to record a VR gameplay and showcase it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you still find interesting what you see. I know I had a blast working on it (especially coming up with this custom material shader for the hologram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few screenshots from the whole place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/uni-vr-2018/Screenshot01-vr.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;467px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came up with the idea that you could pick up a pair of yellow goggles. That would enable you to press a key to put them on. Looking through them would show you writings on the walls, numbers on the hologram planets and so on. Things that would not be visible with the naked eye. You would use what you see to figure out how to unlock one of the puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;66&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;158px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what you see through the goggles (although we didn’t have time to change the textures on the planets to display any secret information yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At what point were the augmentations so manifold, they changed her true nature? After all, thanks to them she was able to connect. A glimpse into so many minds, that every synapse in her brain was firing. A feeling of ecstasy caused by the chemical reactions. It was real. More real than anything she had experienced before. A true connection. But with whom? Or even, with what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece is a special one for me. I put a lot into it and it is not my ordinary scary, monstrous art. And that is why I love it. Took nearly 30 hours which is the piece I have worked the longest so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you do enjoy it as much as I do. Make sure to check out the time-lapse painting (just scroll down and you will see it). Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Making of “Drone of Clouds and Minds” - Time-lapse Painting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEEMr1PVabg&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the video of the making of my last painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I publish my paintings, I always feel the urge to write and explain how and why I went down the path I did with the creation process. Most social medias don’t give you that opportunity though. Also, sadly, most people run around and are so busy these days that I just cant see myself intriguing anyone to sit down and read a piece of writing. No matter if it takes just 5 or 10 minutes, sometimes even less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a following is also hard and I don’t know if this is the place where people are interested in the insights of a struggling artist. But anyways, here it goes (if you like what I say and would like to see it integrated in the video itself next time, do say so please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creation-process&#34;&gt;Creation Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a university drawing assignment calling for the creation of a character. Well no, this here is not the character that I created for university. What I handed in was a half-assed magician with a robe and very broad shoulders. But one of the initial ideas I had with him was: I wanted him to hold a magical fire. And I wanted it to be something interesting, something novel. So I thought, why not follow some mathematical shapes? Maybe he is a wizard that knows every secret of this world? And he resides in a world, where, though predominantly fantastical, science still exists. Who knows, if they had a scientist good enough, they could probably formulate magic itself too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I said - well, his fire will have a three dimensional shape that is a bit more unorthodox. He will be holding a fire that is an polyhedron. Maybe icosahedron? 20 faces. That didn’t matter at the time. I even wanted it more abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/polyhedrons.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;485&#34;
	height=&#34;555&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;87&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;209px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some polyhedrons can be seen above. I especially liked the one numbered 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept stuck with me, but I wanted to explore it in a personal painting, and not something related to university. Here came another idea, one that I had circling in my mind for the prior 4-5 months. A portrait of a woman looking directly into an abstract shape. As such this sketch was born:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/painting_sketch_500_drone.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;500&#34;
	height=&#34;378&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;132&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;317px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see how it started loosing its mathematical concept and went more into an abstraction. The days that followed though, I had doubts whether I want to be exploring something as abstract or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/strong&gt;, the Wizard had some incredible held in off-hand sources and orbs. And although its been very long since I last played, I think that some of the electric colors and interesting shapes had an influence on me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/diablo_wi_400.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;285&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;54&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;130px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the off-hands in Diablo 3. While painting I didn’t use any of this as a reference, but I believe the game had left a mark on my mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me cynical, but a lot of art will circle around and become famous for just being a tiny bit abstract but immensely pretty. There is nothing wrong with it, but I just think people are prone to easily liking stuff that is just pretty and nothing else. Sometimes there even isn’t any deeper meaning into it. I wanted a beautiful painting &lt;em&gt;(for a change in my ordinary monstrous portfolio)&lt;/em&gt;  but I wanted more than that into it. So I started exploring the idea of a robot. Or a drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/drone_sketch_500.png&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;75&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;180px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first sketches of the drone. It ended up looking totally different, but you can see the starting points and similarities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of that you can see in the video itself. Also, this blog post already stretched to be a bit too lengthy, so I will leave the rest of the insights for the video itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you can see in the title of the article above, I created this painting back in 2017. It still holds a special place in my heart and I think I learned a few things whilst making it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are some parts of it that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer really satisfied with as well. The months after I created this illustration I revisited it and slightly positioned the right eye of the character better on her face, fixing it all up a bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I remember I really struggled with aother thing in this artwork back then. It&amp;rsquo;s her skin. The tone and the texture of it. I remember the issue lingering on the back of my mind way back then when I was painting it. I think I gave my best shot at trying to overcome it. Now looking at it through the lenses of time, I don&amp;rsquo;t really think I managed to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have the interest of painting on top of it once again, 6 years later. I believe it would be more productive, and kind of cooler, if I were to take the character and completely repaint / remake them in the skillset I have now. Into a brand new composition. If I&amp;rsquo;ll ever get into doing that though, I am doubtful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet I wanted to describe what I would do differently, knowing what I know now, with the hopes that perhaps it could be intriguing. Or useful to any 2D artist out there reading this right now and analyzing my artistic process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;asd&amp;hellip;to continue writing&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
