        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/sitelaunch/coverLaunch.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Welcome - Website Launch" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about the process of creating the art I share. It all started a bit before I joined university, when I thought I might write a quick explanation behind the process of how I create my illustrations. That was to go along with some speed painting timelapses I had recorded at the time and put up on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At university, when I got into learning 3D, I continued that tradition. End of 2018 I joined my first Artstation challenge. Feudal Japan. In there, people were requested, and encouraged to write blog posts about the creation of their works. Those could be short or long, as long as there were plenty of images to show progress in their entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered then, how to approach my posts. Given I had love for writing prior to that, I thought I might be a bit more wordy in some entries. I through I might share my thought process and why I take the decisions I take in the shaping of the 3D spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed that so much that the following year, once I was making my next scene, one that was not for any challenge, I documented its creation in its own blog entries. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-009/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following all that was the blog entries surrounding the portal, megastructure of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short break followed, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t write as much, as I was moving jobs, from an indie place to where I am working now, as an Environment Artist at Rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I decided to get back into it, though. I had spent the past years on and off building a new personal artwork. I thought this might be another cool opportunity to share insights from my creation process with any reader that might be interested into it. Especially given I had been leaning and experimenting heavily with Nanite, Lumen and all kinds of new features in Unreal Engine 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-blog-website&#34;&gt;New Blog Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I started thinking that I would love to have my own platform for my blogs. My own website, my homestead, so to say. In addition, the many entries from my previous years of writings had been all scattered to the winds. Some of my earliest on Tumblr, few then in their own tab and page for an Artstation challenge, then followed by my Artstation blog section on a completely different URL. Then to go away again on yet another unique page. I had written for some websites as a guest too, and I realized some of those are no longer up online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website of my own would be the perfect opportunity to tie all lose ends and put it all in one place, as it should have always been. That is when I started looking into options and considering what would be the best way to create said website. Oh, what a journey that has been. I am no stranger to web design. My creative journey, some 10-12 years ago, when I was a young, curious kid, started with graphics design and web design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, I enjoyed and did that for quite a long while. My brother Miroslav Dimitrov helped me, doing coding while I would do graphic design. I grew tired of it (which sounds a bit melodramatic for a kid, but it was the truth). As such I started exploring other creative outlets which lead me straight into 2D art and painting. That was with the idea to one day do concepts and illustrations for video games. All of those countless of hours playing Lineage II and World of Warcraft could not go to waste, after all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2D to 3D then to breaking into the games industry in late 2019 first as a 3D Generalist / Tech Artist. Then to move to Rebellion in 2021 as an Environment Artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that? To circle back to web design now, in the creation of my own blog space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating, writing and deploying a website, be it static or more complex is much more pleasant experience now in 2023 than it was back in 2013 when we were fully engaged with that craft, together with my brother. As such I can&amp;rsquo;t say, or take, too much credit for many of the work that goes in here. If you are curious as to how it was created, or want something similar of your own, you can explore the link at the footer of this page. Still I want to put special thanks to Jimmy, who is the original creator of the template I used and revamped to fit my artistic and visual inclinations. I also want to say special thanks to Miroslav, my brother, who helped me figure out and remind myself with the intricacies of web so I could accomplish what I have in this website. I appreciate all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;archives---older-blog-entries&#34;&gt;Archives - Older Blog Entries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this blog going live, forward on I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing new entries about the current projects I have. There is one, I&amp;rsquo;ve code named &amp;ldquo;Shape Ritual&amp;rdquo; where I explore a ruined, circular room with a floating, magical orb in the middle. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to tell you, and show you all about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can find all of my previous years of writings and blog entries here too. They are dated to the original time and ported in here identical as they were originally, in the moments I wrote them first. There are no changes a part from a small grammatical or typo fixes here and there. Some of the platforms I initially used to write parts of them also didn&amp;rsquo;t have easy way for adding alt text on images. As such I&amp;rsquo;ve went back and added image descriptions on some pieces that might have initially missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the entries, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated with new information. Or new thoughts. Or recollections from what I remember I had circling in my mind back then, but left unsaid (or more like unwritten). In those entries, you will see a clear division between what was the original post and what is a newer update. I hope you enjoy those updates as with most of them I&amp;rsquo;ve strived to inform and educate on anything new I&amp;rsquo;ve come to learn since then, improving performance, fixing tech issues or just setting up common good practices for creating 3D art and playable, realtime game scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;suggested-reading&#34;&gt;Suggested Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering where to begin, I&amp;rsquo;ve got some suggestions for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to go into a more chronologically inclined way, you could begin over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-019/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This link will take you to see the final blog post and as such the final result.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would like to dive from entry one from the series instead? Seeing the look at my early exploration and moodboard gathering? You can do so over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine - 01 - Start&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was created with Unreal 4, Maya, Substance Painter and Designer and if you explore the entries of it, you will find behind the scenes screenshots from those softwares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancy starting the one of the more recent ones? You can give a go to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Like above, this link will take you to the end, final showcase of the project, letting you preview the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Very early UE4 screenshot of &amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway&amp;rdquo; showcasing a megastructure in the middle that later through the works shapes to be a giant portal with tiny greeble and cable details on its surface.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To teleport yourself right into the very beginning, first entry of the series, you can go over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Orbital Gateway - 01 - Reference / Concept&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be a fan of punk and horror noir, then I&amp;rsquo;ve got just the thing for you. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-009/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; will scratch your cyberpunk itch in a macabre flooded in neon lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/sitelaunch/HighShot00028.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Early blockout screenshot from the project &amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo;. Created in Unreal Engine 4. Image showcases a small hill with a chapel on it. The chapel has neon signs attached. In front of that are lots of gravestones.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the very first entry, try out this link - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard - 01 - Start&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you find insight and inspiration in some of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-me&#34;&gt;Support Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who like to read and observe my art and for those who might have found insight or knowledge and have the resources to consider it, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a way to support my works. At the bottom of most blog entries you will find a Ko-fi button. It takes right where if you wish you could drop a tip. A coffee, so to say. That support would mean tons to me and would allow me to continue writing and creating the art that you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strive for my insights and educational pieces to be free of charge. Easy to access by anyone and everywhere. As such if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the means to, don&amp;rsquo;t feel obliged to drop a tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to Ko-fi in the blue button below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39; src=&#39;https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;&gt;kofiwidget2.init(&#39;To support my art and writing, tip me on Ko-fi.&#39;, &#39;#428beb&#39;, &#39;W7W4LKBRP&#39;);kofiwidget2.draw();&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to quickly share with you something I am immensely excited about. The project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while now, at Rebellion, finally got its reveal trailer. NDAs lifted, finally (well at least in small parts).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of fun and got to work with many super talented individuals on this game. It&amp;rsquo;s been a blast in creating and learning and I hope everyone gets just as excited by the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sniper Elite 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a lot of fun working on this and it&amp;rsquo;s been a very valuable learning piece as well. I hope everyone else had just as much fun and I want to thank all of you who stopped by in this blog for the kind comments and encouragements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Victor Fritsch for creating the amazing concept piece that this environment is based onto. Make sure to check out his profile and art in the links a bit further below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fly-through-video&#34;&gt;Fly-through Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my fly-through showcase video. I tried to make it an interesting one and worked a bit on the sounds too. I hope that you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention was to make the environment visible from multiple angles and have it as much &amp;ldquo;game ready&amp;rdquo; as I could. As such in this backside view I reused some of my assets to try some storytelling and showcase a part of the gateway &amp;amp; stargate that is damaged and malfunctioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating this portal effect and experimenting with it has been a really enjoyable process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mixed panning materials with noises and textures fed into normal, fresnels and refractions used onto multiple tori. On top I also placed a particle system I created in Niagara to give even more movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;callout-sheets&#34;&gt;Callout Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are some behind the scene shots. Starting with callout sheets of the assets and materials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-018.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Callout sheet screenshot. Showcases eleven sci-fi, hardsurface panels. Each has different greeble details, cables and metallic (chrome and gold) parts.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of 11 panels above was one of the parts of the project that took me the most time. I tried to created them detailed and interesting while balancing geometry and 2D texture details and hard surface stencils here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panels are arced when seen from above and are measured to be modular and snap perfectly when rotated around, forming a cylindrical structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-019.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another callout sheet. This time around the rest of the props used in the scene are overlaid on a checkerboard plane. These props consist of: portal, platforms, heads with eyes covers by cables, cable bundles for scattering, spline meshes, reusable pieces put into those splines.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I relied heavily on spline systems reusing the same few base meshes. By the end all spline actors were converted and baked into packets of static geometry so draw calls are minimal and the environment is optimized and runs well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-020.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Materials callout sheet. Consists of 4 UV spheres. Each has a different material applied: chrome metal, gold metal, cable material one, cable material two (looks like insulation tape). Below those is a cylinder with a material that has square greeble details. To the side of that is a flat plane showcasing hardsurface intricate details baked flat.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left you can see a trim sheet that is used in the background. To the right are hard surface stencil details and decals I modeled in Maya and then baked in Substance Designer in order to distribute across the arced platforms for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timelapse-video&#34;&gt;Timelapse Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also created this time-lapse video that combines screenshots taken in the process of making the envo in engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make this one final post, to wrap up the last eight entries of the series. I want to do that so I have the opportunity to sort of mark and number the entries, as blogs can sometimes be a bit chaotic, and it might be hard to keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can see a gallery with the finished work over at my&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9eOVKo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are. The end. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it. This is the first project of such a big scale that I&amp;rsquo;ve done in 3D, and it was quite the ride! As I promised, I worked a lot on a video, in order to show you the idea of the whole place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Animal Shrine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; As some of the Japanese texts I have on the walls of my calligraphers workshop suggest, this shrine is a place where you can leave gifts and pray to different animals. At first, it sounds like it is a thing for fortune, and good health, but read deeper and you shall come across sentences like &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those who bring gifts shall have powers&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Point at your enemies and the animals shall follow&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The commander of the animals&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I say anything more, here is the video. Enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-flythrough&#34;&gt;Video flythrough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vi0vBi39h2g&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(YouTube video embedded above. It&amp;rsquo;s the main flythrough video showcase of the scene.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japanese culture, as well as in lots of others, the animals I have depicted have a very common appearances. In Japan rabbits are thought to bring fertility, cranes were thought to be immortal and as such were considered secret. Frogs, some say, bring luck. All of that is referenced on the walls of the calligraphers, but I wanted to take it further. See if I could come up with something more mysterious and weird. And then actually have a go at executing it and telling it as a story through a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite the challenge, I will tell you, and I redid that video about 4 times. Unreal&amp;rsquo;s Sequencer gave me lots of trouble too. It was good though, that along the way of making my props, I was exposing every single parameter possible. That gave me control over the colors of the lights, and the glowing eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a second video for you. A sort of a development time-lapse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(YouTube video embedded above. Shows a timelapse of the building up of the entire scene, from the placeholders beginning to the end.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not take 431 screenshots, in order to have them unrecorded and not seen&amp;hellip; This is not all of them, of course, but I made sure to take lots of specific angles through the making, and them combine them in a video. Hope you find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Low angle screenshot, from the ground. Shows the circular shrine with the bamboo candles and the stone lantern. All of the lights are recolored from their ordinary orange, to a cold, magical blue. The animal statues now have their eyes light up and those are also in aggressive, white blue colors.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with this shot above, but I am leaving it down here, in the hopes that you first see it in the Video, and won&amp;rsquo;t get the whole surprise element spoiled.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now lets go to some technical talk. I recorded the scene in real time. The FPS is around 40-50 constant, but would occasionally drop down to 25-30 when looking through the cameras that overlook absolutely the whole place. I think you can feel a few frames drop on the first video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I was kind of convinced that I will not be able to record anything in real time, given that I am pushing my models and textures to appeal visually at their best. LODs are something I would love to do, but maybe not in a short challenge like this. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to be very reasonable with my choice of texture sizes and my stacking of multiple objects on one texture sets. My machine is not bad, but it is by no means top-end either. I have a strong video card (gtx 1070), but pretty outdated CPU and only 8 gb of RAM. As such I am actually pretty happy with how the scene is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;materials-and-callout-sheet&#34;&gt;Materials and Callout Sheet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see my materials and call-out sheet for my models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First row: paper, gold, porcelain, bamboo. Second row is my landscape blending materials plus a weird looking hay I used for the &amp;ldquo;hanging rope&amp;rdquo; detail piece you can see in the second picture.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Material callout sheet two. Shows another 8 UV spheres. Between them are 2 tiny ones. In order of appearance: wood warm and light, wood darker, wood mahogany, wood mahogany intricate. The next 4 uv spheres are of &amp;ldquo;Smart Materials&amp;rdquo; set up in Substance Painter using the above previous 4. Those are wood and mossy stone surfaces. Between all spheres are the final 2 tiny ones that show paper lantern texture and base stone texture.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First row here is some basic wood materials I did in Substance. I then combined them in different ways, using Smart Masks in Painter. Last material is the stone I use in the scene. I made a simple one with exposed parameters for cracks and for hue. I then overlaid green version on top in order to make some cheap moss effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was lots of fun to do guys. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to bed all night. I mean, its morning here in the UK right now, but when I woke up around 20 hours ago, to begin work on this, I knew it was going to be my final day on it. It made me feel kind of weird, melancholic. It&amp;rsquo;s stupid, I know, but lots of you are so amazingly good at what you do, my only chance to catch up was to work crazy hours. And in those crazy hours, I got so used to this project, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m gonna feel empty for a quite a while, given that I will not wake up to have a stroll in it first thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all of you out there for the kind comments and words I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten along the way here. Also, great thanks to all of my relatives, and friends, who put up with me, talking about this project, every. single. day&amp;hellip; Got quite a lot of support over at my university too, so thank you guys over there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to mention my friend &lt;strong&gt;Rika Kanaya&lt;/strong&gt; again. She is the one behind the translations of my weird ideas from English to Japanese. She guided me through on how to put it in texts. Thank you Rika!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed my project, and I hope that the video and story gave you at least a bit of a kick-out. I think I will have a long break now. Maybe spend a week or two, just in the realms of the 2D, with some casual painting. :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. As always, have a good one. May we meet again in another project, just as fun as this one (but maybe, a titbit less stressful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recollections-and-memories-update-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recollections and memories. Update from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As I am here porting this old blog log into my new, personal blog website, I wanted to spend a few lines and talk about things I remember and recollect from this project. From the time I wrote the above at 4-5 am, in that sunless, British morning in my student accommodation flat over in Preston where I studied Game Design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above I talk about melancholy. I very much to this day remember the feeling and could go on to describe it in detail even now, 5 years later. Indeed, the daily opening and navigation of the scene branded into my mind strongly the space. For the following months, even a year and a bit after I finished this scene I remember having occasional moments of closing my eyes and in front of me, in my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye, seeing the Japanese scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was happening and was incredibly strong the few days after I finished the project so I occasionally had moments of pondering if this project will indeed be engrained into my DNA for the rest of my life and if I will be revisiting it in my nightly dreams all the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a few more scenes and I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of them have come as close as to this one as being entangled into my mind and my psyche. That is even through the fact that most of my scenes after this one, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more hours on and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and done much better job at detail, space, texture, color and composition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There might be only one space so engrained into my mind, now that I think of it. That would perhaps be my section of the Sniper Elite 5 multiplayer map &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flooded Village&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; that I worked on over at &lt;em&gt;Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;. If in the scene above I spent two and a bit months of opening it and navigating its space daily, then Flooded Village I have spend 3-4 times that. As such I got the same &amp;ldquo;Tetris effect&amp;rdquo; where on some days my mind wonders off and I go into a daydream. In that daydream I find myself into the space and zones of Flooded Village.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tech talk though&amp;ndash;things I got wrong above, in the initial post in 2018. I talk about pushing my visuals to the very max and as such my performance suffering when I am overlooking the entire Japanese scene. Well, yes, I did give it my max but back then my max was not that demanding on resources as detail in textures, and geometry, is relatively lacking. That is if you compare it to my current works. As such there was another missing piece of the puzzle. The piece dragging my performance down. That is &lt;strong&gt;draw calls&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though the lanterns you see above lack animations at the end, I did leave them as Movable Blueprints, as such splitting each lantern into its own, individual draw call. The little tiles that make up the paths, I scaled on the x;y;z in all kinds of fractions, splitting each and one of them into individual draw call as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not run any profiling to see my draw calls in that scene (I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about it back in 2018). And I hardly have the time to go back into that project now and check, but I can guarantee you that indeed the draw calls are needlessly high.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such whenever you work on your projects, pay attention to them. If you wish, you can read more about draw calls over&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(if you somehow missed the blog in the first place).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find the gallery for &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo; with all of its screenshots and videos over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/aRoa1k&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with its problems this project still has a special place in my heart. Over time, in the last few years, I also realized that this is one of my most popular projects (most likely due to me writing about its process over at 80 lv website. Also being featured in The Rookies and getting printed in 3D Magazine thanks to a rubric about The Rookies.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its making I think I&amp;rsquo;ve grown a lot and learned tons more about art, 3D, composition and crafting good spaces. Yet I try to embrace this project, knowing how much it&amp;rsquo;s enjoyed by most of the lovely people that follow my art online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such thank you very much for reading through the blogs about the making of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for all of the nice words, to those of you who have reached out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the best,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
