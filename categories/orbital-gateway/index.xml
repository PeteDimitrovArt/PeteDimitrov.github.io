&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Here is my final post with finished presentation images and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-or.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a lot of fun working on this and it&amp;rsquo;s been a very valuable learning piece as well. I hope everyone else had just as much fun and I want to thank all of you who stopped by in this blog for the kind comments and encouragements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Victor Fritsch for creating the amazing concept piece that this environment is based onto. Make sure to check out his profile and art in the links a bit further below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fly-through-video&#34;&gt;Fly-through Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my fly-through showcase video. I tried to make it an interesting one and worked a bit on the sounds too. I hope that you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Content warning: there are flashing lights.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the main flythrough showcase of The Orbital Gateway.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-screenshots&#34;&gt;More Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more close up screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-002.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The cylindrical megastructure of The Orbital Gateway, seen from an angle. Lots of yellow lights are dotted around and sync in with the golden metal surfaces.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-005.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Upper, further away angle screenshot. With a slightly lowered FOV. Shows the side of the megastructure that is damaged, sparks flying in the air and portal shut. There is a platform to the left with people showing the scale of the entire place.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention was to make the environment visible from multiple angles and have it as much &amp;ldquo;game ready&amp;rdquo; as I could. As such in this backside view I reused some of my assets to try some storytelling and showcase a part of the gateway &amp;amp; stargate that is damaged and malfunctioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-006.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Lower than before camera angle. With FOV even further down. In the middle of the megastructure are panels with lots of pipes, cables, hardsurface groves and greeble details.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating this portal effect and experimenting with it has been a really enjoyable process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-012.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mixed panning materials with noises and textures fed into normal, fresnels and refractions used onto multiple tori. On top I also placed a particle system I created in Niagara to give even more movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few portrait shots:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;callout-sheets&#34;&gt;Callout Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are some behind the scene shots. Starting with callout sheets of the assets and materials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-018.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Callout sheet screenshot. Showcases eleven sci-fi, hardsurface panels. Each has different greeble details, cables and metallic (chrome and gold) parts.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of 11 panels above was one of the parts of the project that took me the most time. I tried to created them detailed and interesting while balancing geometry and 2D texture details and hard surface stencils here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panels are arced when seen from above and are measured to be modular and snap perfectly when rotated around, forming a cylindrical structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-019.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another callout sheet. This time around the rest of the props used in the scene are overlaid on a checkerboard plane. These props consist of: portal, platforms, heads with eyes covers by cables, cable bundles for scattering, spline meshes, reusable pieces put into those splines.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I relied heavily on spline systems reusing the same few base meshes. By the end all spline actors were converted and baked into packets of static geometry so draw calls are minimal and the environment is optimized and runs well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/peter-dimitrov-the-orbital-gateway-020.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Materials callout sheet. Consists of 4 UV spheres. Each has a different material applied: chrome metal, gold metal, cable material one, cable material two (looks like insulation tape). Below those is a cylinder with a material that has square greeble details. To the side of that is a flat plane showcasing hardsurface intricate details baked flat.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left you can see a trim sheet that is used in the background. To the right are hard surface stencil details and decals I modeled in Maya and then baked in Substance Designer in order to distribute across the arced platforms for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timelapse-video&#34;&gt;Timelapse Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also created this time-lapse video that combines screenshots taken in the process of making the envo in engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing a time-lapse of the making of The Orbital Gateway.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lighting is baked. Full list of software used: Unreal Engine 4, Maya, Substance Designer, Substance Painter, Zbrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original concept is by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/vittorio&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Victor Fritsch&lt;/a&gt;. You can see his entry &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/contests/grand-space-opera-light-age/challenges/93/submissions/59200&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud and fog particles use flipbooks by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/smoke-builder&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;W3 Studios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man mannequin is by Epic Games but the woman one is from this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/female-mannequin&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Kevin MacLeod&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sounds that you hear when the camera is close to the portal are by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/features/halloween_sounds.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two years after finishing this project I revisited my timelapse video source files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original timelapse was three minutes and a bit. I exported a sped up version, taking it down to 23 seconds and showcasing all of it a bit quicker and snappier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 12 - Bits and Pieces</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00253.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 12 - Bits and Pieces" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-angle&#34;&gt;Main Angle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last update before the very final post in the next days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00253.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle screenshot. The cylindrical portal megastructure. Colors are refined and the background has a bit more detail in the likes of chrome and gold, large pipes.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on various odds and ends. My main focus has been to polish anything that catches my eye and sticks out. Also to improve my storytelling in any further way I can. I tried to clean up the lights around the portal apertures as well. Lowered the blue leak but increased contrast when you look inside it and see the pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added a second layer of sorts to the portals&amp;rsquo; Niagara VFX I&amp;rsquo;ve been making. It&amp;rsquo;s white and yellow dot particles, spawned on a torus and accelerated to go inwards. Adds just a bit more movement and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;niagara-gif&#34;&gt;Niagara Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it in this heavily compressed gif here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-portal-finalized.gif&#34;
	width=&#34;994&#34;
	height=&#34;544&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up of the portal VFX. Lots of refraction and emissive dots swirl around in yellow colors on the surface of the tori otherwise in blue hues.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;182&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;438px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely to the very inside and middle of the portal, you can see a radial movement with polar coordinates. I added that yesterday as the previous one I had was just flat pan in U direction on a cap and it looked bit bizarre once you were to take a closer look and notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;malfunctioning-side&#34;&gt;Malfunctioning Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worked and polished a bit more the side with the malfunctioning portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00254.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The side of the portal megastructure that has an opening malfunctioning. Next to the long platform leading to the portal diaphragm, there are now cables and an empty floating platform otherwise used by people for transportation and maintenance.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added more cables on the platform, improved scale and texture on the existing few and added a &amp;ldquo;parked&amp;rdquo; levitating platform with some metal pieces on it, as if someone were in the middle of repairs. I also scattered few decals here and there to add variety and interest on the platforms that were slightly too pristine before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did yesterday was to add more lit up panels in the background using texture. You can see it in the first picture above. I vertex painted an emission mask with small dots here and there, to go on top of my original trim sheet used on the outer walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working on my final camera shots and movements for the video. My sequence is mostly done now.  I might add few more angles tomorrow, as once I record and go in the video editing software, most of the time I end up slicing and cutting half of the shots away anyway. I also have to take a look into some soundtracks and SFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone&amp;rsquo;s final sprint for the challenge is going well, and that it is not too stressful, haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next presentation post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 11 - Smoke and More Stencils</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/pd-or-11.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 11 - Smoke and More Stencils" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-screenshot&#34;&gt;Main Screenshot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how my scene is looking after some work from the past days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/pd-or-11.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle from Unreal, showing the cylindrical mega-structure and its portals. When compared to the previous post, the blue glow from the gates and the VFX for the portals is much more powerful. The piping on the ceiling and the floor now also give off smoke and vapour VFX, showcasing radical changes in temperature.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scaled around and made some of the pipes larger. I did that with the idea of filling up the lower and top empty space of the composition better. I also though it will improve the feel of the whole cylindrical portal and make it feel even more immense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vapour-vfx&#34;&gt;Vapour VFX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then moved onto introducing some smoke and vapor particles. I wanted that in order to give the scene even more life and make it feel bit industrial as well. You can see preview of that below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/voMcH5XL4ZE&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the raising smoke and vapour as seen from the main camera angle of the project.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smokes are Cascade particle systems that are mostly my own creation. I did however borrow the use of a flipbook (animation sheet) from a 3rd party as it was a bit of a stretch for me to make one from scratch in the little time left. It also would have looked horrible because I have no experience making or baking animations or FX onto singular frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then moved onto animating some sparks. I also damaged the hull of the inside of the shut off portal and made some aggressive fumes quickly leaving the pipes. See a preview here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLDSd4G274M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing another VFX effect. This time around its Niagara sparks that come off some torn sci-fi cables.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those sparks were made from scratch, not in Cascade, but in Niagara instead. If you fancy something similar there are plenty quick tuts out there and results are pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;portal-vfx&#34;&gt;Portal VFX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then tried to give more movement to the edges of the portal, especially as seen from profile. I did that again through a Niagara system. I spawn bunch of particles on a torus, have them on moderate lifetime and lower their opacity while apply directional velocity and killing them once they reach certain edge. The effect adds this to the portal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOtvuXOB81Q&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the portal VFX. Close up camera orbits the portal and shows dark, sci-fi smoke that adds more dimension to the edges where portal VFX meets metal props.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cylinder-surface&#34;&gt;Cylinder Surface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely on the overall surface of the whole portal, you might notice I also baked and added a lot more hard surface patterns and details. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make some of the otherwise empty surfaces even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might do another progress update in the next days, before wrapping up everything in order to submit after that. I&amp;rsquo;ll start a timeline and animate my fly-through cameras, so I might show you some previews of that next. I still need to put in some better poses for the mannequins on the platforms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 10 - Recolored, Depth Fade, Stencils</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00226.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 10 - Recolored, Depth Fade, Stencils" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;recolor&#34;&gt;Recolor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick update with some recoloring and some other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00226.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle. Compared to the previous post this time around the atmosphere and the color in the air are revamped. Most of the colors are in blue and teal, blue, green-ish ting. The only other color is of gold and yellow lights dotted around.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original concept had blue tint while my vision of it so far was mostly warm gray. (If you would like a reminder of how the original concept looks, you can find it in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;blog one of the series&lt;/a&gt;). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to follow the concept word for word, but I could not stop but feel I might be missing out by not trying the colors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such after some experimentation I landed on the colors you see above. I liked those quite a bit more than the original warm tomes I had going on. I then went into trying to clean up the portal / event horizon VFX even more. The previous one was too emissive and noisy for my liking and I though it was too busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another angle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00227.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Side angle showcasing the cylinder device in a spot where the right portal is on but the left one is malfunctioning and off. On the left one, that was in red lights last time, we now see a tint towards white and yellow lighting.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see I cut out the concept of the red, warning like colors. I still want to convey the idea of the gate being partially broken and malfunctioning, but maybe going for red and alarming colors was too obvious and easy. Sure it worked out but I think there are more creative ways to do it, I just have to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gamut-analysis&#34;&gt;Gamut Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/color-gamut-peter-dimitrov-cap073.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1524&#34;
	height=&#34;528&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two screenshots. Left is the old view of the scene, with red lights. The right side is the new view, with more yellow and blue lights. Next to each of those screenshot is a gamut look analysis, breaking down the colors and showing them onto a circular color selection with the colors used highlighted. When looking at the version with mostly yellow and blues, the color selection is clearly much more controlled and limited.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;288&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;692px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gamut is much more limited in colors now and I think the end result is quite more harmonic composition wise. You can see a reading of it in the picture above.
I added some cut and exposed wires but I have yet to try adding some sparks and other animated VFX. That might help sell the malfunctioning concept without the use of the red color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baking-normal-details&#34;&gt;Baking Normal Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I went into making some more pipes for the background. I also made a depth fade shader that gives a force field like effect where some of the pipes go through. Then I went into creating some hard surface stencils and baked details to use and stamp in Substance Painter. I modeled them in Maya and then baked normals of them in Substance Designer. I took those normals to use in Painter. I have just a few going on now but I&amp;rsquo;m going to make more in order to cover some of the otherwise empty areas on the panel surfaces of the portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it below:&lt;/p&gt;

In the middle: those same 3D pieces loaded into Substance Designer and baked onto flat planes, producing 2D textures. To the right: the baked normal details used on some of the geometries in the scene.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progression&#34;&gt;Gif Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a GIF of my dances with colors:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 09 - Red Portal, Refractions</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00190.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 09 - Red Portal, Refractions" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lights&#34;&gt;Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00190.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main angle screenshot from Unreal 4. The cylinder large structure of the portal device is in focal point of the image. The openings with the portals now shimmer in additional emissive sparks on their VFX tori.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on a part of the cylinder in the back that from my previous angles was completely invisible. There was pretty much nothing going on there and I decided to try some storytelling by using some of my existing assets but in a slightly different way. I got the idea that maybe one of the portal gates in the back is malfunctioning. It could have gotten damaged during a spaceship passing. Now the portals&amp;rsquo; event horizon is closed. Red lights indicate of something being wrong. You can see it below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00193.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Camera screenshot from a bit further to the left from the one seen in the shot above. Here the circular portal opening is damaged. As such the portal is not powered and the VFX is not on. Instead the viewer can see an open cylinder. It&amp;rsquo;s eerie lit in red, as to indicate malfunction.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might make some cables that are cut and damaged and just hang in there in the red cylindrical part. I could also add some sparks coming out of them. Or gas with visible vapor from some of the wider pipes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extra-angle&#34;&gt;Extra Angle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00194.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot with an angle similar to the one above. This time though, camera is slightly above. It&amp;rsquo;s also much further away from the cylinder and portals seen, and with a much lower FOV, zooming into it but eliminating a bit of the perspective distortion.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some visible artifacts in the light bakes seen through predominantly black faces on some of the cables. I&amp;rsquo;ll fix that next though.
Now that I have this new angle I&amp;rsquo;ll have even more room for movement in the final video, which is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vfx-improvements&#34;&gt;VFX Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scaled few things here and there but then went onto experimenting in the VFXs a bit more. I wanted to try to add some refraction. I though it might be a nice way to add even more depth and interest in the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by adding just clear refraction on a sphere and then setting that sphere in a position similar to the gates. That produces the distortion that happens on the edge surfaces. A bit like what fire generates on its tip and hottest points.
I then liked so much how the refraction turned out that I decided to also revisit my panning main material for the event horizons. In it I was panning just noises and fresnel but this time around I also added refraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all you can see video preview here:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut from the main camera. Movement is static but the video showcases the VFX of the portal.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;orbital-stargate-peter-dimitrov-cut003.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made a Light Function that casts water-like caustics. The function is put on a point light that goes in front of the gates. Adds yet another layer to the VFX. I tried to keep color and opacity of it quite subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another preview:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Another video cut showing the refraction sphere in front of the blue portal even better. To the left is a red, malfunctioning portal.&#34;&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Quick update with a few things in my scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00182.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Main angle camera screenshot from Unreal 4. Progress from last post showcases lots of splashes of gold and yellow on the surfaces of the portal cylinder and its greebles. There is also some of that, together with sci-fi, square grid wall textures, in the background.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, I spent my attention on mainly two things. First was working on the platforms that the humans sit on. I created a proper mesh to replace the previous placeholder. I also made a material with gradient I can tweak and put colors and noises on top of in order to get that force field effect. I experimented with a few colors for it but ultimately ended up with the one like in the original concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then moved onto the background once again. I tried to improve the protrusion bits I had placed previously. I wanted the hard surface to look proper and as if part of the room and like weld metal, as opposed to the previous golden supports that looked just like clipped through.&lt;/p&gt;

Also occasional yellow lights scattered here and there. In the middle of the picture is a cylindrical opening and platform. That is where spaceships would float through, going towards the portal.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worked more on my trimsheet that I deploy in the background. I added a part to it that has panel-like details and greeble like features. You can see that above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optimization&#34;&gt;Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this takes us to today. Tonight I decided to try optimizing the scene a bit. I had spline meshes, non-static parts and materials in the scene that I wanted to improve tech wise. It would not be a successful video at the end, if I were to leave the performance as it were and recorded at 15 FPS. : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before. Constant at 75-80 ms:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;SCENE RENDERING screen shown in Unreal 4 Editor. Lists and details RenderViewFamily, Draw calls, and other profiling stats. Most important one here, for this case study, is the stat third from bottom to top: Mesh draw calls. In this picture it reads 1,696.45.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;175&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;421px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After. Stable at around 18 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/Screenshot_2021-02-04_184841.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;744&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screen identical to the previous. Important stat is again: Mesh draw calls. In this &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; picture it reads 306.00.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;418px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some more clean-up and with no &lt;em&gt;stat scenerendering&lt;/em&gt; on, I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at a stable 10 ms. Quite better even than the previously mentioned 18 ms. This is not in standalone form so one could argue it might be even better there. I think for recording the video I&amp;rsquo;ll play a timeline through a cooked standalone project and maybe get a bit of a boost in ms from that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ms-comparison&#34;&gt;MS Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I think it will do for now. Here is one final comparison to an ms observation from a week ago to show you how slow it was, lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress&#34;&gt;Gif Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But away from this, and back to visuals. Here is a GIF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly mention how exactly I accomplished the big win in performance above. I think anyone with experience can derive and make an educated guess, just by looking at my stat scenerendering profiling pictures above. Yet I write and share these posts with a lot of students too and I wanted to explain it a bit better for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the making of this project, I heavily relied on spline blueprints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When there is a long platform, be it straight geometry or cylindrical motives, instead of placing by hand a repetitive, modular piece, I would feed that piece into a spline blueprint system of my own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It made the art creation process much more quick and powerful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is one caveat though. When you work with spline blueprints like that you end up leaving all parts as &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be able to edit a spline curve on the go too, the nodes derive tangent points.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of those pieces stack up in draw calls. When you place one long platform that is a spline blueprint, instead of having say 1 to 5 draw calls you end up with 150-200, because of all of the spline components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you put an identical platform spline blueprint copy next to it, that gets its own 150-200 draw calls too. They don&amp;rsquo;t get bundle together with the first one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew this from the very get go, when I started adding splines. I knew I will need to go back and clean up and &amp;ldquo;bake&amp;rdquo; my geometry into truly static geometry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Before&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;After&amp;rdquo; screenshots above, you see me doing exactly that. I select my spline blueprints and I use the Unreal 4 Editor integrated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Actors/Merging/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That turns my one, super long platform (for example) that has 150 draw calls into one piece of geometry, that is say mid-poly, but is 1 draw call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I then reuse that super long platform, to the sides, by replacing the rest of the similar blueprints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t change the x y z scale of those copied platforms (otherwise the draw calls get separated again, even if not as bad as before).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doing even more actions, similar to the above description, I optimized the draw calls in my scene from 1,696.45 to 306.00.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That on its own got me from 77 ms (12 fps) to a 10 ms (94 fps).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unrelated to the Blueprints or Splines above, but if you are using the Unreal Geometry Brushes to block out spaces, bear in mind they have similar caveat of draw calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each of those brushes, in its nature to be editable on the go, comes with dozens of draw calls instead of optimized just a few calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I often come across student&amp;rsquo;s block out projects that run at bare minimum FPS. They often ask and wonder why that happens and most often my advise is either to bake down all of their Geometry Brushes to truly static, non editable geometry, or to start blocking out using primitive Static Meshes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have fun in Unreal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 07 - Relit Scene, VFX</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot000150.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 07 - Relit Scene, VFX" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-lighting&#34;&gt;Different Lighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back for an update with a different lighting and some portal VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot000150.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera angle, Unreal 4. Shown is the large, cylindrical portal structure. The gaps where the portals are, that were blank, emissive cards before, are now replaced for fluid-like VFX shader on a tori.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the scene from last time, most lights were overlapping and causing quite a few baking issues. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave them to Movable and as such dynamic instead of Static. Mainly because I want the scene to run well in real time so I can record a video at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the fact that my previous version was arguably making the whole greeble details very flat. As such I decided to completely revamp the lights. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with them now and performance is much better although I might brighten it up a bit more here and there with any future progress as I don&amp;rsquo;t want the scene too dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing the relighting I decide to have some fun with the portal effect itself. I also really disliked the fact it was completely white and empty as in my opinion it was breaking the picture a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vfx-video-showcase&#34;&gt;VFX Video Showcase&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut orbiting around the VFX and showcasing it.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;orbital-stargate-peter-dimitrov-cut001.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a custom shader that utilizes few Perlin, Clouds and Plasma noises exported from Designer. Few of those are b&amp;amp;w greyscale masks, but a few I also exported as converted Normal maps with crazy high intensity. The Normals I unpacked from Tangent to World space and I then feed into a Fresnel function. I exposed few parameters for tint, color, emission, fresnel power, fresnel emission and custom opacity control that lerps the b&amp;amp;w noises together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material I slapped onto a torus. It&amp;rsquo;s cut in half and some of the faces are prolonged. UVs on it are straightened and then when I put the material on it together with a UV panner I get the effect as if energy is moving inwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result that you see in the video above is just three tori, varying on size, overlapping one another, with three instances of the material graph that have slight variance in color, emission and panner direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In there you can see through the transparent bits of the portal some pipes and metal elements. I thought it would be cool if you could peek and it was not completely opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is me going bonkers with a spline and Duplicate Special set to instance in Maya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/dup-special-curve.gif&#34;
	width=&#34;1246&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Short gif from inside Maya. Showing use of &amp;ldquo;Duplicate Special&amp;rdquo; to edit a spline that is instanced. The relationship between the instances makes for a diaphragm opening and closing animation when editing.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;349px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was lots of fun and I recommend trying it if you ever do circular designs and your package of choice is Maya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-screenshots&#34;&gt;More Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can probably notice I did some work on the background too. I started blocking out some rooms and primitive details just today and I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing more of that tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to soon start bringing the background to a good level of detail when compared to the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orbital Gateway - 06 - Metals and Textures</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Quick update with a latest preview of how the scene is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dived into UV mapping and some materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot000123.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main UE4 camera shot, showing the portal cylinder. Material and texture work can be seen, with the greebles now having metallic shine while cables appear rubber and blue and there are some golden trims scattered too.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the panels still don&amp;rsquo;t have textures. I went with silver/chromium look tied up with some gold and golden trims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;panels&#34;&gt;Panels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I managed to go through four of the panels and texture them. I laid them out on the same UV texture set so they share bitmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not completely happy with the detail, noises and colors on them, but I&amp;rsquo;m setting up everything with smart materials so I should be able to easily tweak all of them. I just need to UV map the rest tomorrow. Fun. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View of just the mapped panels plus the gate frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-cap073.jpg&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;153&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;368px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background I started with a trim sheet so I can easily introduce some patterns later on. Though arguably it will need some geometry there too as to not be too flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress&#34;&gt;Gif progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process gif:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-006/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-005.gif&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll need to work more in order to balance the amount of detail on each panel through their textures. I want some panels to have golden elements too but I am going slow in order not to overwhelm it. Also I want to map and texture to the existing level the other 5-6 panels and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start trying the same changes uniformly on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to bake some normal stencils and decals that I will then stamp directly on some of the empty surfaces for some extra detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any comments are appreciated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual I spent even more time on the greebles and putting more detail on them. I made one or two new greeble panels and I am up to nearly 9 of them in total now. Two of which still have a few empty corners. I also struggled to reuse them in one or two places specifically, where no matter which one I put it became obvious there is repetition. So I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just make a final extra one before calling their number be set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sculpt&#34;&gt;Sculpt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some experiments with some details around the portal entrance itself too. I made an aperture-like piece that has sharp, fangs-like appearance. But before that I also made a sculpt of a face. It&amp;rsquo;s eyes are covered by cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-005/peter-dimitrov-2021-01-20_232220-02.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;218&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;524px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sculpted it in Zbrush. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that much detail but arguably it&amp;rsquo;s not really needed for it to have any as it&amp;rsquo;s just a detail piece mounted above and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really need to be a centrepiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress gif:&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fang bits have placehold gold material although I think I might keep a type of gold by the end too. On some of the greebles and most of the portal I will try some light and silver metals and as such I really want to try to contrast some gold pieces and details here and there too. For a renaissance or art deco in outer space kind of a style.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start the materials and textures I&amp;rsquo;ll also tint everything towards more blue most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always forget to mention this, but I am thinking of later on having a go at some VFX and interesting visuals for the portal plane itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it completely white as it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. I&amp;rsquo;m back with an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-004/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00072.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Main camera shot. The cylinder now has panels nicely cut, showing gaps in-between. To the side is a small floating platform with humans on it. It&amp;rsquo;s lit in a yellow glow. The space has a lot more fog too.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly building up more detail. There is still quite a bit of empty surface area but I&amp;rsquo;ll be tackling that the next days. I spent 2 days doing just cables and greeble details and it was quite exhausting at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such today I took a break from that and worked on the overall picture, atmosphere and lightning. It&amp;rsquo;s not final but at least now I covered the big hole on the ceiling that I had in the placeholders. I had Directional Light coming from there and once I got rid of that everything went quite dark and I had to build it up bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;upper-parts&#34;&gt;Upper Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-004/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00074.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Camera angle similar to the first picture. This time around its pointed slightly more up, though. That way it showcases a lot of hugo, vacuum-like pipes around the ceiling.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was good fun and I finally got to do some pipes on the upper part of the Stargate portal too. It was empty before but you could not see it because of the limited camera angle. I intend to have video with movement at the end and different FOV and as such I had to put detail up there too, I could not just ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting challenge with the Volumetric Fog. Once I closed off the ceiling and removed the Directional Light, the Volumetric Fog turned pitch black-like. You can see it in one of the steps above, though in movement&amp;hellip; oh boy&amp;hellip; it was much worse looking when flying around. I had to tweak a bit but ended up with result I quite like. I did not want to give up on Volumetrics and disable them because that removes my eerier blue glow I so much want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any materials, textures or colors. I am purposefully keeping myself away from that for now though. I think there will be plenty of time for that once I have all of the geometry and shapes and silhouettes in. That&amp;rsquo;s what I am focusing on now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know its bit too gray now but I&amp;rsquo;ll be playing with that soon, as a reward once I make even more cables. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;An update on the Stargate Orbital Station with some work I did the past days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00051.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main camera screenshot, showcasing the cylindrical structure. Compared to the last blog update, this time around the portal openings have a frame around them consisting of wires and greeble details.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary focus has been the geometry around the portals and on the face of the cylinder itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building it up slowly with cables, fuse boxes and other details. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to increase the variety and fidelity even more once I block out the basic shapes on the faces that are still empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif&#34;&gt;Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a gif of things in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-002.gif&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I should approach the details on the cylinder as if they were greebles back when I picked the concept. I was worried that might make them look very squarish and nearly committed to just doing freehand placed geometry. I was having lunch next and I could not stop thinking that not trying more modular approach might be a mistake. I also had the imagine of this old puzzle toy my grandparents used to keep in their house back at home in Bulgaria when I was a kid. I could not get it out of my head. So I went back, took measurements and split the circumference of the cyl into few even pieces. I then started putting details on top of those pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-003/peter-dimitrov-progress-img001.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Three screenshots put next to one another. First one is UE4 shot that shows the cylinder with panels color coded to show the asset usage. Second is a hand holding an old Soviet puzzle toy. Third is the panel cuts from one, but this time showed in Maya with details.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toy I mentioned is seen in the middle. &lt;em&gt;(Googling an obscure, long word descriptions of it gave me a result saying &amp;ldquo;old Soviet puzzle toy&amp;rdquo;. Brilliant.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End result is a bit more modular and structured than just placing random bits here and there. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to produce a small library of 7-8 of these &amp;ldquo;arched panels&amp;rdquo;. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll build the whole structure through just them. I also decided I&amp;rsquo;ll probably not constrain myself perfectly into some of the panels so there is better feel of flow and it looks less forced into rectangles later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, somewhere by the end I could also produce few pieces of cables and other details that serve literally as foliage (but are not plants, lol) and are scattered in engine to give even more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cables&#34;&gt;Cables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, making cables and wires was fun, why would you ask? &lt;em&gt;Smile.&lt;/em&gt; Jokes a part the first few are kind of fiddly but then you build a small library of few curves and finished wires and you can easily knock out new ones through Soft Selection &lt;em&gt;(in Maya)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know they look very high poly right now, but I am keeping their back faces and proper edge loops for easy iteration. Once I start finishing the panels though, all back sides that are not seen are getting deleted, lots of the edge loops that don&amp;rsquo;t add that much flow will go as well. Result should be not too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next post,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First project update from me. Here is some progress from the past 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00032.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;UE4 screenshot. Large, gray cylinder with gateway-like cuts. Inside the cuts are overpowering, blue emissive cards. Around are long, straight pipes and metal platforms that go outwards of the platform in all directions like chains.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been mainly blocking out the space and making sure the scale and placement is correct. Not many details yet, but there will be time for that later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I did the other day when I started was to block out some rough shapes directly in Unreal using the basic Brushes. Instead of dragging the shapes around, I used the settings tab and put in specific values for the size of each thing. What I had at the end of that day was pretty meh visually, but it was important that I had some numbers and measurements figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I went in Maya where I started the proper geometry, again using the values I had picked in the Brushes. After making few of my static meshes, I put them into Unreal with a gray, placeholder materials. I then experimented a bit more with fog and light and had a scene that looked a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress-gif&#34;&gt;Progress Gif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my tradition I started back a few challenges ago (with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-019/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Feudal Japan&lt;/a&gt; one) and export some progress GIFs and animations in some of my blog updates. Here is one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-001.gif&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I mainly created some of the shapes on the cylindrical room, as seen in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;splines&#34;&gt;Splines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipes, by the way, are made by a small cut section of a mesh I modeled in Maya that was then used in a custom Spline tool I created in Unreal. That enabled me to easily create all of the different shaped pipes you see. I need to bake them into proper geometry later on, as they are just non static Blueprints right now and that will cause issues with lighting later on when I start baking lights, but for now though, it will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone else is having fun with their scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I took a part in the challenges here &lt;em&gt;(this project was part of Game Environment/Level Art Artstation Challenge 2021. That is what I was referring to here back when I initially wrote this.)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start the gray boxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, here is the concept I chose to go with. I fell in love the moment I saw it and I think it fits very well what I usually go for visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-concept-art&#34;&gt;Main Concept Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stargate Orbital Station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and its a concept by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/contests/grand-space-opera-light-age/challenges/93/submissions/59200?sorting=popular&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Victor Fritsch&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for the lovely artwork, Victor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I decided to go with this one is because I think it would be an interesting practice in hard surface and machine and pipe-like details. I want to push my hard surface skills so I though it&amp;rsquo;s ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my larger reference sheet. &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding to it later on)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece is of course Victor Fritsch but I also included a few other ideas and thoughts I have for my plan for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I included H.R Giger because I think it would be an interesting challenge to try to mimic some of the type of organic, but at the same time industrial feel he creates in his works. I also love the thought of the white silver/chrome, metallic look and I think I might try that for the surfaces in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From other challengers I included a piece by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/contests/grand-space-opera-light-age/challenges/93/submissions/57899&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Alex Mordovets&lt;/a&gt; as I want to later on try to have some kind of a visual effect inside the portal gate. Alexs&amp;rsquo; piece has a black hole as the focal point and I though that is an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another artist I included, that I came across on here on Artstation is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/WKrk9D&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Alec Tucker&lt;/a&gt; with his Viscera project. His work is very masterful and I love the gritty, film grain look in the final piece. I will try to have my artwork tid bit brighter but I think there is lots I can learn by Alec as long as I keep an eye on his piece whilst I work on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;
